<td>White Sturgeon occur in western North America in the Fraser, Columbia and Sacramento-San Joaquin rivers. In British Columbia they occupy the Fraser, Columbia and Kootenay river systems, as well as Harrison and Pitt Lakes. They are primarily freshwater fish; however some individuals enter rivers, estuaries and bays along the coast<br />(there is no evidence of breeding in coastal rivers). The extent of occurrence in B.C. is 46,158 km2, based on freshwater distribution (COSEWIC 2012f).<br /><br />COSEWIC (2012f) describes the following 4 designatable units (DU)/populations as follows:<br /><b>Lower Fraser River population:</b> "...restricted to the Strait of Georgia and the lower Fraser River. It extends from the Fraser Delta to Hells Gate (about 204 river kilometres upstream)."<br /><b>Upper Fraser River population</b>: "...encompasses about 1,000 km of the mainstem Fraser River between Hells Gate and the confluence of the Morkill and Fraser rivers. There are three geographic groups of sturgeon within the DU: the middle Fraser, upper Fraser, and Nechako River sturgeon groups.<br /><b>Upper Columbia River population</b>: ??restricted to the mainstem Columbia River between the U.S. border and Revelstoke Dam in British Columbia. Here it encompasses about 425 km of the upper Columbia River. Suggestions of a remnant population between Revelstoke and Mica dams are unconfirmed.?<br /><b>Upper Kootenay River</b>: ??restricted to Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay River between upstream of Bonnington Falls and the Idaho border with British Columbia.

<td>AC = Very high - medium</td>


<td>The main threats to White Sturgeon are habitat degredation from dam construction and changes to flow regime that appear to cause recruitment failure (COSEWIC 2012f). Threats to each population differ, ranging from Medium to Very High (Upper Columbia: High; Upper Kootenay: Very high-High; Upper Fraser: High-Medium; Lower Fraser: Very High-High (B.C. Conservation Data Centre ND; accessed July 17, 2019). Details on threats for each population can be found in COSEWIC (2012f) and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2014).<br /><br />With the exception of the lower Fraser populations, white sturgeon appear to be endangered throughout their historical range in the province, primarily because of flow alteration by dams on the Nechako, Kootenay, and Columbia rivers (Apperson 1992; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994; Hildebrand 1991; R.L. &amp; L. Environmental Services 1994; D. Ableson, pers. comm. 1992). An apparent decline in the eulachon (THALEICHTHYS PACIFICUS) populations in the lower Fraser River, a major food source for sturgeon, may be a cause for concern there (M. Rosenau, pers. comm. 1992). Loss of productive slough habitat in the Fraser Valley is probably reducing the potential for young sturgeon as well (Lane 1994). Contamination with heavy metals and other pollutants is also of concern. Recent unexplained deaths of large fish in the lower Fraser are a serious concern.</td>

Conservation Data Centre ND; accessed July 17, 2019).<br /><br />Populations in the Fraser below Quesnel are producing young, but there has been a significant decline in the number of juveniles appearing in the fishery in recent years (M. Rosenau, pers. comm.). Certainly they are much less abundant in the lower Fraser than they were historically (Lane 1991). Other populations such as those in the Nechako, Kootenay and Columbia rivers are even more threatened, with few or no young being produced or surviving in recent years (Apperson 1992; Hildebrand 1991; R.L. &amp; L.

<td>AB = Very high - high</td>


<td>COSEWIC (2012) summarized the threats as recruitment failure, river regulation by impoundments; siltation due to an existing dam; low genetic diversity. There are uncertain benefits of hatchery propagation (use of wild fish as broodstock).<br/><br/>Long term cumulative effects related primarily to construction and operation of the Libby Dam are suspected. These include low and reduced seasonal water flows, changes to water temperature and the species makeup of the community, loss of nutrient inputs and possibly siltation. Post spawning mortality factors are the primary long term threat, as evidenced by the absence of juveniles and young adults in the population (Apperson and Anders 1991, cited by Duke 2001).</td>



<td>AD = Decline of &gt;50%</td>


<td>COSEWIC (2012) estimates that there has been a decline of over 50% over the last three generations, with a decline of over 90% observed between 1978-2001 (COSEWIC 2012).<br/><br/>Historically abundant, the population has been declining since construction of the Libby Dam in the early 1970's (Apperson and Anders 1991, cited by Duke 2001). Recent observations confirm the remaining wild population is largely comprised of adult individuals older than 25 years (Duke 1999; Ireland <i>et al</i>. 2000). Recruitment failure is suspected because despite spawning, significant survival past the egg stage has not been observed. Wild adult Kootenay River sturgeon can be expected to decline well into the future (Duke 2001). Hatcheries are seen as only viable option for stabilizing this population and preserving genetic diversity (Ireland <i>et al</i>. 2002).</td>


<td>A = Decline of &gt;90%</td>

<td>There is an 80% chance of this population going extinct in the next 100 years (COSEWIC 2012). The Duncan and Slocan Lakes remnant populations will eventually be lost (COSEWIC 2012). Causes of decline are understood (i.e., habitat and flow changes due to dam construction and human alterations);..</td>



<td>A=Highly vulnerable</td>

<td>This population is limited by low numbers of female spawners during any given year (Apperson and Anders 1990), therefore spawning may not occur on a yearly basis; few spawners to produce large numbers of eggs, therefore cannot replenish the population. This population is also genetically distinct, therefore supplementation efforts have to be careful not to reduce genetic viability (Apperson and Anders 1990). Kootenai white sturgeon have been observed to spawn (in US only) over shifting sand substrates, which may suffocate eggs and larvae, thus causing survival bottlenecks (Rust et al. 2004).</td>


<td>A=Very narrow.  Specialist or community with key requirements scarce.</td>

<td>Studies suggest that for optimum spawning, flows below Libby Dam should be held above 630 m3/s, ideally 1200 m3/s, with a temperature range of 9.5 to 12 'C (Paragamian and Wakkinen 2002). Spawning observed to stop with changes in water temperature over 0.8 'C (Paragamian et al. 2003); spawning ceased when water temperatures dropped below 8'C (Rust et al. 2004).</td>


<td></td>



<td>Monitoring and evaluation of hatchery program required over long-term (Ireland et al. 2002). Studies required to determine the success of eggs/larve if adults moved to spawn in habitats with gravel/cobble substrates, as opposed to shifting sand substrates that are currently used (Rust et al. 2004).</td>


<td>Inventory needs include confirming wild population size and composition in terms of year classes, wild versus hatchery reared individuals and wild fish spawning survival rates. Additional work is needed to confirm presence and population dynamics elsewhere in the Kootenay River Watershed i.e. Kootenay Lake, BC. Studies conducted in 2002, indicate that hatchery-reared juveniles have 60% survival rate in the first year of release and 90% in subsequent years (Ireland <i>et al</i>. 2002).</td>



<td>Protection measures including policy-based actions such as recovery plan development and implementation; communication and education programs and site-based habitat research. Immediate protection measures include maintaining and restoring existing habitat and identifying new protected areas. An experimental conservation fish culture facility has been established, at Bonner's Ferry, Idaho, operated by the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, backed up by a fail-safe facility at Fort Steele, B.C. Longer term protection measures include the restoration of natural recruitment (J. Ptolemy, pers. comm.). Recovery plans have been established and in-place since 1999 (USFWS 1999).</td>

<td>The effects of dam construction and ensuing river regulation and their combined effects on spawning and rearing habitat are undoubtedly the most serious contemporary threat to White Sturgeon in the Upper Columbia.Recent modelling and experimental work by McAdam (2012) has provided strong evidence of the causal mechanisms behind recruitment failure in regulated rivers. The White Sturgeon is a fluvial species and, although it regularly occurs in large lakes, it requires flowing water to complete its life cycle (COSEWIC 2012). <br />Both groups of white sturgeon are subject to threats of habitat degredation and loss through dams, impoundments, channelization, dyking and pollution (UCRWSRI 2002).</td>

Both groups consist of older adults. Younger age classes have not been present since 1966 and 1980 for the Arrow Lakes Reservoir (ALR) and transboundary groups respectively (UCRWSRI 2002; Golder Associates Ltd. 2005).

In the Columbia River population, mature males were observed to be smaller (106 to 207 cm FL) and younger (16 to 46 years) than females (137 to 271 cm FL; 27 to 65 years) (UCRWSRI 2002). The UCRWSRI committee (2002) indicates that the female spawning interval in the upper Columbia River was much greater than the 3 years reported for the lower Columbia in the United States.  Even though spawning is observed yearly in the transboundary group (UCRWSRI 2002), a lack of recruitment does not allow any recovery from population losses.</td>


<td>C=Moderate.  Generalist or community with some key requirements scarce.</td>

<td>White sturgeon are highly adapted to riverine systems and are opportunistic feeders (UCRWSRI 2002). Populations throughout the Columbia and Kootenay river systems display a broad range of environmental preferences, however, it is not known if preferred habitats have been reduced in these systems. The upper Columbia River population may have spawning cues based on water temperature and/or discharge (R. L. &amp; L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2001), however, it is not known how changes to these cues due to river regulation has impacted spawn timing and periodicity.</td>

<td>The UCRWSRI (2002) has identified several research requirements including: i) water management (e.g., flow augmentation, defining flow requirements for spawning, assessing impacts of reservoir operations on early life stages); ii) water quality (e.g., impacts of dissolved gas on larval stages, turbidity augmentation to reduce predation on eggs and larvae, impacts of low water temperatures on early life stages); iii) contaminants (e.g., identify all sources in the Columbia River, assess concentrations in sturgeon and habitats, assess physiological effects on growth, survival and reproduction); iv) habitat (e.g., largescale changes in habitat associated with basin development, feasibility of restoring habitats, passage, increasing productivity); and v) population assessment (e.g., continued stock assessment/spawn monitoring/juvenile assessment, assess other remnant populations, recruitment bottlenecks, genetic baseline, disease/parasites).</td>


<td>Inventory of this population has been on-going since the early 1990's. The UCRWSRI (2002) indicated that continued assessment of the adult stock, as well as yearly spawn monitoring and juvenile indexing is necessary for the recovery of this population.</td>

(2006) estimates a decline up to 55%. From 2004-2011, there was an increase in the number of adults (from 4550 to 8460; COSEWIC 2012). Nelson et al. (2012) reported a 77% increase in the numbers of adult sturgeon from ~4,550 to 8,090  between 2004 and 2011 although wide confidence intervals on yearly estimates were present and the overall trend was not significant (r = 0.12, P = 0.73) (in COSEWIC 2012).<br /><br />The impact of the historical fishery varies depending on the interpretation of data available for the commercial sturgeon fishery (only total weight of landings was recorded). Under some scenarios using stock reduction analysis, Walters <i>et al. </i>(2005) were able to show that the numbers of fish removed may have been higher between 1960-80 due to interception in the commercial chinook gill net fishery; this is based on the assumption that the average size of the fish harvested in the early fishery was much greater than it was for those intercepted in the later salmon fishery. Catch data suggest the abundance of small fish (1-7 years) has been rapidly increasing since 2000; age and size composition data suggest relatively healthy numbers of older fish in the population that is either stable or increasing (Walters <i>et al.</i> 2005).</td>

Walters et al. (2006) estimate that the Lower Fraser white sturgeon population has declined by at least 50% since the late 1800's; Walters et al.

Hypoxia is difficult to address in the current regulatory and policy context and is likely the single largest threat. Although it is poorly known, predation by introduced species is currently considered only a moderate threat, as these species appear to have coexisted with Salish Sucker for a decade in some parts of their range. However, the ubiquity of introduced predators and their documented impacts on other species justifies the ranking of this threat as moderate.

<td>In BC, lake chub occur in all major drainages: Columbia, Fraser, Skeena, Peace, Liard, Stikine, Taku and Yukon; however, they are only rarely found within 100km of the coast (McPhail 2007), and have not been recorded on Vancouver Island or Haida Gwaii (Scott and Crossman 1973).

<td></td>


<td>Lake chub are ubiquitous in the Interior Plateau and in the northeastern portion of the province (of which there are over 200 recorded occurrences; also McPhail 2007) and so it is likely that these areas provide good viability. However, lake chub form scattered, isolated populations at the southern end of its BC range (McPhail 2007) and so it is unknown if these sites still provide good viability.</td>

<td>As the lake chub is often the numerically dominant species in a waterbody (McPhail 2007), and it occurs in 433 different water bodies, it is likely that there are over one million fish in BC, but the exact number of lake chub present in BC is unknown.</td>





<td>D = Low</td>


<td>The threats to lake chub have been calculated to be low using the IUCN calculator. Lake chub are abundant and widepread across North America, and are found in all major drainages in BC (McPhail 2007). There appears to be little concern about the conservation of lake chub as a species, as lake chub has a wide distribution, often high local abundance, and occurs in a wide variety of habitats (COSEWIC 2004). However, lake chub occurs throughout northern BC, where it could be negatively affected by any increase in oil and gas development or mining. As it is a cold water adapted species, an overall increase in temperatures could reduce its range. Use of rotenone in the 1950s and 1960s extirpated lake chub from several water bodies (McPhail 2007). It is unknown if the construction of any new dams or resultant change in water management will affect lake chub.</td>



<td>G = Relatively Stable (&lt;=10% change)</td>


<td>The abundance trend of lake chub is unknown, but believed to be stable, as it is found in many different locations throughout BC and is believed to be one of the more numerous fish in many water bodies (McPhail 2007).</td>


<td>U = Unknown</td>

<td>The long term trend for the lake chub in the Interior Plateau and northeastern area of the Province is unknown but believed to be stable, as the lake chub in those regions are very abundant (McPhail 2007). However, many lake chub populations were eradicated with rotenone in the 1950s and 1960s, which resulted in scattered and isolated populations in southern BC (McPhail 2007); therefore, it is believed that the lake chub populations in the south-central portion of the province have declined.</td>



<td>C=Not intrinsically vulnerable</td>

<td>Lake chub mature at the end of their second summer or the beginning of their third summer; females can produce up to 10,000 eggs (McPhail 2007). The lake chub is found throughout BC and in a variety of habitats (McPhail 2007) and therefore it is believed to have relatively high dispersal capability.</td>


<td>D=Broad.  Generalist or community with all key requirements common.</td>

<td>Lake chub appear to be adapted to cold water habitats (COSEWIC 2004). Lake chub are primarily lacustrine at the southern edge of BC, but occur in a variety of habitats elsewhere in the province, including mainstems of large turbid rivers, tiny rivulets, small eutrophic ponds, and large oligotrophic lakes (McPhail 2007)</td>


<td></td>



<td>A lot of the material used to describe the life history and biology of lake chub in McPhail (2007) was from studies conducted in Saskatchewan and the eastern United States. Preliminary molecular data suggests that there are major sequence differences between BC and Ontario lake chub populations (McPhail 2007).</td>

The Atlin Warmspring population also had significantly lower activity for enzymes known to be used in cold tolerance (Eric Taylor, pers. comm.; Charles Darveau, pers. comm.). Atlin Warmsprings has stable temperature over a relatively narrow range, in contrast to the Liard Hotsprings which has more variability in temperature; it is thought that the temperature stability in the Atlin Warmsprings has resulted in the loss of the ability to cope with cold water (Charles Darvea, pers. comm.). Mitochondrial DNA sequences from hotsprings lake chub (from the Alpha swamp in the Liard River Hotsprings and also from the Atlin Warmsprings) were compared with two cold water populations (In the upper and lower Liard River); these sequences suggested that the four populations were equally distinct from each other (COSEWIC 2004). The current geographic and reproductive isolation between the hotsprings and cold water populations have likley resulted in rapid divergence; these genetic adaptations have probably evolved post-glacially and independently in each population (COSEWIC 2004). Liard Hotsprings lake chub grow faster (30mm in length during the first summer); mature earlier (at age 1, instead of age 2-3); and die younger (generally by age 2, rather than age 4) than cold water populations (COSEWIC 2004).</td>

"<br /><br />2010 rank assessment: Presently, there are no major threats to Cowichan Lake lamprey, but given its restricted distribution, it is vulnerable to changes in water or habitat quality or other localized threats (COSEWIC 2008). Given the lack of knowledge on the general biology and habitat needs of the species, current threats are difficult to quantify. The significant decline of coho salmon, their most commonly observed host, is thought to directly impact the abundance of Cowichan Lake lamprey (COSEWIC 2008). For example, coho salmon escapement in the Cowichan Lake system (including Mesachie Lake) averaged 46,860 in the 1950s, 40,250 in the 1960s, 44,620 in the 1970s, and 20,550 in the 1980s, representing a decline of nearly 46% over the last 24 years (or 3 lamprey generations), and 73% since the 1950s (Baillie pers. comm. cited in COSEWIC 2008). Deliberate destruction of Cowichan Lake lamprey adults when caught by recreational anglers may have adverse effects on the population (COSEWIC 2008). Mortality rates for this threat are not quantified, but dwindling salmon stocks may lead to increased acrimony toward lampreys from anglers, who are known to kill lampreys in an effort to help declining salmon stocks. Siltation of littoral spawning areas caused by forestry activities or residential and commercial development is thought to be a minor threat to Cowichan Lake lamprey populations (COSEWIC 2008).</td>

"Without a more accurate method of measuring lamprey abundance (e.g., markrecapture studies), it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about population trends. As an alternative method of examining population trends, MacConnachie and Wade (2016) suggest electroshocking the same areas for ammocoetes every two to three years and comparing counts over time."

However, the population appears to fluctuate from year-to-year. Changes in salmonid scarring rates may provide an index of the number of adult lampreys per year. The magnitude and frequency of such fluctuations have not been sufficiently quantified, but data from Mesachie Lake suggest that the number of lampreys between 1987-1996 was lower than that prior to 1982 (COSEWIC 2008). The number of juvenile or adult lampreys caught during the same time period in the downstream trap at the Mesachie Creek enumeration fence ranged from 4 (in 1991) to 60 (in 1995), while the number of coho salmon smolts recorded with lamprey wounds ranged from 139 (in 1989) to 1982 (in 1996).

General biology of the Lake Cowichan lamprey is poorly known and should be further studied. To determine the severity of the threat imposed by declines in target host species, particularly coho salmon, the lamprey's behavioural, numerical and life history responses should be studied. Although there is indirect evidence to suggest that the Cowichan Lake lamprey moves between Cowichan and Mesachie lakes, this needs to be studied and quantified. Little is known about dispersal within each of the two lakes, further study is required to identify seasonal movements among habitats.</td>

<td>Sites in Delta, including Westham Island, and Burnaby (inlcuding Deer Lake, Burnaby Lake and the Brunette River) likely have good viability, as large numbers of brassy minnow were captured in those areas (Nowosad 2011). However, some sites produced very low catches of brassy minnow (I.e., Richmond sloughs and Sumas River; Nowosad 2011) and therefore it is likely that not all of the 22 sites have good viability. Furthermore, some appear to be seriously impacted by introductions of invasive species (Nowosad 2011).</td>

Sites in the sloughs of Delta captured 169 fish (Nowosad 2011). Sumas River sampling caught only 8 fish, while sloughs in Richmond resulted in the capture of 26 fish (Nowosad 2011). Using a sampling efficiency of 0.3 (Bryant 2000), there would be approximately 7000 fish present in the Lower Mainland region (data from Nowosad 2011), although this is likely a conservative estimate.</td>





<td>B = High</td>


<td>The threats faced by the brassy minnow include impacts from agriculture and urban environments, negative effects from drying up of ditches and sloughs (both due to loss of habitat and loss of connectivity between water bodies), and presence of exotic species (and, in some locations, subsequent extirpation from historic habitats) (Nowosad 2011).

The brassy minnow populations in the Sumas River and in the sloughs of Richmond are believed to be in decline, as the abundances are very low. The degree to which they are declining is difficult to determine given lack of quantitative data but this region has seen a significant increase in invasive fish species presence - several are known to be piscivorous. Declines within the past 3 generations are likely to be 5-10%.</td>


<td>EF = Decline of 10-50%</td>

<td>The distribution of brassy minnow in the Lower Mainland has declined since the 1950s (Nowosad 2011). While there are historical records of the brassy minnow being captured in the Coquitlam, Pitt, Alouette, and Stave rivers, as well as in the Hatzic, Nicomen and Vedder drainages, none were captured during a recent study, and only low numbers were captured in Richmond sloughs and Sumas River; i.e. only 2 of 8 sites still contained brassy minnow (Nowosad 2011).The brassy minnow is currently very abundant in Westham Island, and reasonably abundant in Deer and Burnaby lakes and the sloughs of Delta (Nowosad 2011), and therefore these populations are likely to be relatively stable. Long-term declines in the range of 10-50% would not be surprising.</td>



<td>C=Not intrinsically vulnerable</td>

<td>The brassy minnow matures after one winter, females produce up to 1000 eggs, and in some years brassy minnow have a second fall spawning period in the late fall in the Lower Mainland (McPhail 2007). However, the dispersal capability of the brassy minnow is unknown, and it has been extirpated from sites without recolonization occurring.</td>

<td>EF = 41 to &gt;125</td>

<td>It is likely that most if not all of the recorded occurrences have good viability: the Peace River and Upper Fraser regions had high catch per unit effort (CPUE) (Nowosad 2011), and McPhail (2007) stated that the areas around Prince George and Vanderhoof had abundant brassy minnows.</td>



<td>Rank Factor not assessed</td>


<td>Brassy minnows are protected under the Fisheries Act, but are not found in any provincial parks. At one time, brassy minnow were present in the esker lakes between Prince George and Vanderhoof (McPhail 2007).  However, these lakes became a provincial park and brook trout were introduced for angling purposes; brassy minnow disappeared after that introduction (McPhail 2007).</td>


<td>FG = 10,000 - 1,000,000 individuals</td>


<td>Sampling in the Peace River and Upper Fraser River had higher catch per unit effort (CPUE), measured as fish caught per hour (0.083 and approximately 0.07, respectively), than for the same month in the Lower Mainland (approximately 0.02);sampling in the mid-Fraser had slightly lower CPUE (0.016) than the same month in the Lower Mainland (Nowosad 2011). McPhail (2007) stated that the brassy minnow was abundant in lakes and low velocity streams near Vanderhoof and Prince George. The overall (year-long) CPUE for the Lower Mainland was similar to the CPUE in the Peace and Upper Fraser Rivers; over two thousand fish were captured in the Lower Mainland in that year (Nowosad 2011). At an estimated sampling efficiency of 0.3 for minnow traps (Bryant 2000), there would be at least 7000 fish in the Upper Fraser site, and even more brassy minnow would be present in the Peace River site (using data from Nowosad 2011). Therefore, a conservative estimate of population size for the western Arctic region would be 100,000 individuals.</td>





<td>CD = Medium - low</td>


<td>Many population declines observed in minnows have been due to river fragmentation and the construction of dams (Nowosad 2011). The introductions of invasive species have also caused population declines in minnows (Nowosad 2011); McPhail (2007) stated that the introduction of eastern brook trout into the esker lakes around Prince George and Vanderhoof caused the extirpation of the brassy minnow in those locations. It is unknown what effect any increase in oil and gas development or mining will have on the brassy minnow populations in the western Arctic. Due to the disjunct nature of the populations, any further changes in water connectivity (i.e., through dams or other barriers) would be detrimental to this population. Possibly the greatest threat is with respect to the fact that the habitats in which Brassy Minnow is often found do not garner attention as key fish habitats; therefore, there may be less inclination to protect these waterbodies to the degree that salmonid-bearing streams are.</td>



<td>G = Relatively Stable (&lt;=10% change)</td>


<td>The Upper Fraser and Peace regions likely have very stable stocks of fish. The trend for the mid-Fraser population is unknown.</td>


<td>U = Unknown</td>

<td>The long term trend for the Peace regions is likely to have declined, due to the creation of Williston Reservoir (Randy Zemlak, pers. comm.). It is also possible that there has been a slight decline in the mid-Fraser population (as fewer fish were captured in this region than in the other two regions) and in the Upper Fraser area (when eastern brook trout caused the extirpation of brassy minnow in the esker lakes around Prince George and Vanderhoof; McPhail 2007).</td>



<td>B=Moderately vulnerable</td>

<td>Due to the isolation and disjunct nature of these brassy minnow populations (Nowosad 2011), extirpated populations in some areas might not be able to reestablish naturally. However, at present they appear to be abundant in this region (Nowosad 2011).</td>


<td>C=Moderate.  Generalist or community with some key requirements scarce.</td>

However, there did not appear to be genetic differentiation between the Pacific (Lower Fraser/Lower Mainland) and western Arctic (Upper Fraser/Peace River) populations (Nowosad 2011). As the two populations occur in two different Freshwater Biogeographic Zones (Pacific and western Arctic; Madrak 2003), and their distribution is disjunct, they are being considered separately.</td>

However, the extremely small size of the population exacerbates the effect of any threat and any further loss in the number of fish increases both genetic risks (such as inbreeding) and demographic risks (such as the loss of certain stocks).

For the Adams River (Shuswap Lake), there were 16503 fry and 1967 parr, with a maximum escapement of 390 fish (Bison 1990). The CPUE for rainbow trout in Okanagan Lake is 0.085, which is slightly higher than Kootenay Lake (0.02-0.05, however, anglers in Kootenay tend to target larger fish; Webster 2007).

The integrity of the rearing streams for spawning and juvenile fish can be affected by water withdrawals, sedimentation, and barriers to fish passage (i.e., caused by agriculture and forestry; NCL 2001).

The Gerrard rainbow trout peak counts have been increasing since 2002 (Harvey Andrusak, pers. comm. 2011). With the efforts to increase kokanee in Kootenay and Okanagan lakes over the past 20 years, and the increasing number of sockeye returning to Quesnel Lake, it is likely that in those systems the population has remained stable or possibly increased.</td>

The Petitot River specimens probably drifted downstream from Bistcho Lake in Alberta. Although no breeding fish were taken in the Petitot, the region close to the Alberta border has only been collected once. The Ft. Nelson fish is more puzzling. It was taken hundreds of kilometers from any known self-sustaining population. If it was a stray from the nearest known source (Bistcho Lake) it had to swim down the Petitot River to the Liard River and then upstream against the current to the Ft. Nelson area. A formidable journey against a strong current! The simplest explanation is that there is some unknown, but nearby, source.

Reduced water flow and projected increasing water demands is a a threat to this species (COSEWIC 2006x). Cumulative habitat degradation is also a threat, including water quality issues related to industrial activity (forestry related or the coal slag piles stored above Grand Forks on the Granby River), urbanization (sewage) and agricultural run-off, i.e., irrigation/water diversion in terms of changing run-off paterns and demand in relation to climate change leading to extended low-flow periods (COSEWIC 2006x).<br />Its restricted distribution makes it vulnerable to any catastrophic event affecting a single drainage system (COSEWIC 2006x, McPhail 2007). However, an event that would eliminate speckled dace from the entire upper river is very unlikely McPhail 2007).

There is not a lot of population and trend information available for the many different bull trout populations and designatable units found throughout BC (COSEWIC 2012; Hagen and Decker 2011). Many of the populations studied show stable or increasing trends, however certain regions, such as the heavily developed Lower Fraser, show overall declines (Hagen and Decker 2011). There has been no evidence of decline in numner of mature individuals (COSEWIC 2012). This DU is located entirely within BC, in 5 watersheds: Lillooet, Lower Fraser, Lower Fraser Canyon, Skagit and Squamish. The majority (1750 out of more than 2325 individuals) of this DU is found in the Skagit system, with approximately 575 individuals found in the Squamish system and lower numbers in the other 3 locations. The main threats are from habitat degradation and fragmentation from forestry and the associated road building; introduced brook trout, which can displace and/or hybridize with native bull trout; overexploitation (through illegal harvest and incidental by-catch, as well as intense angling efforts; however, there are adaptive management plans and angling regulations in place in many regions as well); and increasing temperatures, due to climate change or change in forest cover (COSEWIC 2012; Hagen and Decker 2011).  The anadromous life history form is unique to these populations. <br /><br />Bull trout are voracious piscivores, and can be very vulnerable to angling effort (Hammond 2004). Bull trout are very sensitive to forestry impacts, as the loss of riparian vegetation and subsequent loss of shading can lead to temperature increases in the streams (McPhail and Baxter 1996; Hammond 2004). Forestry impacts can also lead to an increase of sedimentation, which affects the incubation and rearing habitat (Hammond 2004). Any increase of temperature due to climate change will also have negative impacts on this cold-water adapted species (McPhail 2007). Overall threat impact was assessed as medium-high given uncertainties of climate change for this temperature sensitive species, and fairly limited range all of which occurs in a highly developed region with ongoing developmental pressures.</td>

Michalski (2006) noted that Fry Creek on Vancouver Island is subject to extreme flucuations in water flow due to BC Hydro operations (as part of the Salmon River diversion); high flows have negative impacts on migrating and spawning adults, while low flows impact incubating and rearing Dolly Varden. The Salmon River diversion could also be causing a decrease in watershed productivity (Michalski 2006).

A reduced flow in their spawning streams caused either naturally or by human disturbance appears to cause low recruitment in longfin smelt. Water diversions for domestic and industrial activities (e.g. hydro power generation, agriculture) could result in severe declines in stream flows. Other industries (e.g. mining for gravel and minerals, logging) can cause loss or decline of habitat quality if not properly managed or regulated. Release of effluents from future industrial, agricultural and domestic developments could release toxic substances into pygmy longfin smelt watersheds that are harmful to the fish directly or indirectly by affecting the lake habitat (e.g. through eutrophication). Disturbance from heavy recreational use could also threaten the pygmy longfin smelt particularly since their ecological requirements are so little known. Introductions of exotic fish species or salmon and trout enhancement could increase competition and predation in the lake habitat and cause declines in the populations."

(from http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/species/speciesinfo/_aknhp/Longfin_smelt_final.pdf accsessed 24 October 2011):<br /><br />"Potential threats include habitat alteration, reproductive failure and effects of climate change. Freshwater and estuarine habitats may be threatened by pollution (nearshore chronic and acute pollution, including oil spills, wastewater effluent) and reduced fish passage due to diversion of water, although this is unlikely to impact Alaska populations as severely as those in California. Other habitat alteration and impacts to survival could result from dams, timber harvest, mining, and sedimentation (ADFG 2005). High interannual variability is suggested by saltwater trawl surveys; due to their short 2-year life cycle this species is sensitive to relatively brief periods of reproductive failure (USFWS 1994, ADFG 2005).

Major river systems used for spawning include the Fraser, Skeena, Nass and Klinaklini (Fisheries and Oceans Canada; http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ops/fm/herring/eulachon/default_e.htm). There are 10 in BC that are considered "major" (Hay 1999). Eulachon also occurr on the offshore shelf around Dixon Entrance, Hecate Strait, Queen Charlotte Sound and the West Coast of Vancouver Island generally at depths of 80-200 m. Rivers in BC with runs include Nass, Skeena, Kitimat, Kildala, Kemano/Wahoo, Kowesas, Kitlope, Kimsquit, Bella Coola, Kilbella/Chuckwalla/Wannock/Owikeno, Kingcome, Klinaklini, Franklin, Hemathko and Fraser Rivers (Hay 1999).</td>

<td>By-catch by groundfish and shrimp trawls can be high, however the incidental bycatch by the shrimp fishery has declined since 1997 (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2003). Spawning failures have also been attributed to unnatural noise, over harvest, water quality degradation (urban land development, coastal forest practices) industrial activity (construction, blasting, changes in hydrology) and dredging. Increasing water temperatures have been found to be related to smaller sizes, lower fecundity, and lower returns. There also may be more predators as a result. The temperatures may be beyond preferred maximum for spawning (Hay 1999).</td>



<td>FH = Decline of &lt;30% to increase of 25%</td>


<td>Sharp declines in runs also observed in the Columbia (declined to 5-10%), Klinaklini and possibly other rivers in 1994. Skeena and Kemano populations have shown some recovery since 1994 (Hay 1999). Rivers which experienced virtually no returns in 2000 were: Stikine, Unuk, Skeena, Kitimat, Kemano, Kitlope, Bella Coola, Kimsquit, Owikeeno, and Kingcome Rivers and then good returns were seen in the Skeena and Kingcome Inlets in 2001 and 2002. Concurrently (2000-2002), there has been a recent increase in the abundance of eulachons in marine waters off BC and parts of Alaska. Except for 1996, Eulachon returns to the Fraser have been in sharp decline since 1993. However, the forecast for 2003 looks very good, based on the offshore biomass and age of fish with genetics indicating that they are Fraser and Columbia River stocks. Over the past 4 years there have been very poor returns on the central coast rivers, Gardner Canal, Dean Channel and the Rivers Inlet systems (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2003).<br />Short-term trends appear to fluctuate greatly.</td>

They have not been seen in many traditional spawning areas for many years.<br />Eulachon runs have been observed to suffer drastic declines for years and come back in large numbers as recorded on the Columbia between 1835-1865. However these these cyclical declines have not been observed/recorded in Fraser River populations (Hay 1999).</td>



<td>B=Moderately vulnerable</td>

Improving catch reporting methods and standards can be used to help with inventries (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2003).</td>



<td></td>

<td>All of the biological indicators, presently in use on the Fraser River, are limited by<br />their short time series. Therefore, it is important to continue to collect and refine<br />the pre-season biological indicators for the Fraser River eulachon fisheries,<br />specifically eulachon genetic stock identification to identify river of origin in<br />offshore waters, and the collection of the spawning stock biomass (SSB). These are used to then set catches.

It has only been identified in the Nahanni and Lower Liard rivers, and is closely associated with the Nahanni River Valley located in the upper Mackenzie River watershed (Miller et al. 2008); therefore, it is unlikely to occur in any other watersheds. Specifically, Arctic Grayling presence in the Lower Liard includes: Muskwa, Prophet, Toad, Beaver, Fort Nelson, Petitot, Fontas, Sikanni Chief (Miller et al. 2008).</td>

Two Arctic grayling were captured by electrofishing and one by seine net in the Muskwa River in 2007 (data from Fish Collection Permit FJ07-25405). Assuming 100 individuals per km of river (Miller et al. 2008) and approximately 600km of river inhabited (estimate from Figure 3 in Stamford and Taylor 2004), there could be up to 60,000 fish (juveniles and adults) present.</td>





<td>B = High</td>


<td>Threats to the Nahanni lineage include ongoing forestry and agricultural impacts, continuing and new developments in oil and gas projects and exploration, and mining (Miller et al. 2008). Placer mining increases the turbidity of the water, and leads to a decrease in the number of juvenile grayling that are able to use the habitat (Birtwell et al. 1984). Mining and oil and gas development can result in habitat losses, stream crossings, fish passage issues, and increased metals, total suspended solids and water withdrawal (Miller et al. 2008). Overfishing and climate warming are also potential threats (Miller et al. 2008).</td>

<td>The South Beringian lineage is found in the Yukon, Upper Liard and upper/lower Peace rivers, and the west coast of BC (Miller et al. 2008). The South Beringian lineage has been identified in the Chena River in the Lower Yukon River; the Teslin River and Plate Lake in the Upper Yukon River; Becharof Lake and Copper and Stikine rivers along the Pacific coast; the Blue, Upper Tootsie, Turnagain and Trout rivers in the Upper Liard River drainage; the Keel River inthe Mackenzie River drainage; the Table, Anzac, Nation, Mesilinka and Ingenika rivers in the Upper Peace River drainage; and Burnt and Beatton rivers in the Lower Peace River drainage (Stamford and Taylor 2004).

<td>South Beringian lineage Arctic grayling have been genetically confirmed in 23 different waterbodies (Stamford and Taylor 2004; Miller et al. 2008); DNA testing would likely be required to determine whether this lineage is present in other waterbodies as well. Miller reports Arctic Grayling from: Coastal rivers: Stikine (Klappan, Iskut, Tuya, Spatsizi), Taku (Nahlin, Nakina L., Tedideech L., Alsek); Yukon: Atlin, Tagish, Bennett, Teslin; Upper Liard: Turnagain, U. Liard, Kechika, Dease, Frog; L. Peace: Beaton, Halfway, Pine, Murray; U.

<td>U = Unknown</td>

<td>The number of sites with good viability or ecological integrity is unknown. A number of studies on the Peace/Williston Arctic grayling indicate that these populations are at very much reduced abundance compared to historic times prior to construction of the W.C. Bennett Dam (between 1961-1968). Much habitat was flooded and populations now persist in isolation of one another; however, they are thought to be fairly stable. Elsewhere, local impacts associated with fish introductions, placer mining, gold and copper mining, road and rail development and forestry may compromise some populations in terms of habitat quality and passage (Miller et al. 2008).</td>

<td>In the Prophet River, abundance estimates were approximately 114 grayling per km (Stewart et al. 1982 in Miller et al. 2008). In the Table River there were 31-34 adults/km; in the Anzac River there were 34-82 adults/km; in the Mesilinka there were 20-30 adults/km; in the Parsnip there were 46 young of the year and 29 one year olds per km in 2000 (summarized by Miller et al. 2008). Arctic grayling were described as numerous in the Peace and Finlay rivers; however, only 279 Arctic grayling were captured in the Parsnip, Finlay and Peace basins in 1975, and there has since been a decrease in numbers (Miller et al. 2008). At approximately 1000km of river (likely an underestimate; obtained using Figure 1 in Stamford and Taylor 2004) and 100 grayling per km, there would be approximately 100,000 Arctic grayling present in BC.</td>





<td>A = Very high</td>


<td>The threat to the South Beringian lineage of Arctic grayling has been calculated to be very high. Several kilometres of fluvial habitat was flooded in the Finlay, lower Peace and Parsnip watersheds with the creation of the Peace Williston Reservoir (Miller et al. 2008). Impacts from dams include fluctuating water flows/levels, migration barriers, flooding, loss of habitat and habitat fragmentation (Miller et al. 2008). There are also proposed hydroelectric developments on the McGregor River (which could result in increased sedimentation, increased water flows and introduced species) and Site C (which would cause loss of critical habitats, increased access for anglers, and loss of connectivity between fluvial stocks; Miller et al. 2008). Habitat alteration and degradation have occurred in the Mason River, as a result of forestry and mining activities (Miller et al. 2008). Forestry activities can result in increased sediment loads as well as road and culvert construction, which can increase access to pristine watersheds and become a full or partial barrier to fish passage (Miller et al. 2008). Placer mining has had impacts on the Omineca River (Miller et al. 2008). There are gold and copper mining operations on the Upper Finlay, and forestry on the Lower Finlay (Miller et al. 2008). There are both rail and forestry activites on the Parsnip River, which can result in increased access for anglers, blockage of fish passage, and increased sediment inputs (Miller et al. 2008). The Nation River has forestry development and placer operations (Miller et al. 2008). Coal, oil and gas development are occurring in the Peace Region; there are also agricultural impacts, which include streambank erosion, sediment and fish passage problems (Miller et al. 2008). In the Skeena region, there has been habitat alteration and destruction due to both placer and conventional mining (Miller et al. 2008). Placer mining increases the turbidity of the water, and leads to a decrease in the number of juvenile grayling that are able to use the habitat (Birtwell et al. 1984). Mining and oil and gas development can result in habitat losses, stream crossings, fish passage issues, and increased metals, total suspended solids and water withdrawal (Miller et al. 2008). As Arctic grayling are also a popular sport fish, overfishing is also a potential threat (Miller et al. 2008). Climate warming will also likely affect this coldwater species (Miller et al. 2008).</td>



<td>G = Relatively Stable (&lt;=10% change)</td>


<td>As no index sites have been established for Arctic Grayling, it is not possible to assess abundance trends over time. Ongoing development undoubtedly impacts habitat to varying degrees but it is not possible to quantify trends in the short-term.</td>


<td>EF = Decline of 10-50%</td>

<td>The South Beringian lineage of the Arctic grayling has declined; it is believed that only 1% of the historical abundance is present in the upper Peace River watershed based on genetic assessments(Stamford and Taylor 2005); comparative catches in the Peace/Williston drainage from the early 1980s to the early 1990s suggest a decline as well. Elsewhere, Arctic grayling have undoubtedly experienced local long-term declines associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation. Based on this, declines for this group might be expected to be in the range of 10-25% over the long-term.</td>
