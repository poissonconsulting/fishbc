They ascend rivers to spawn, but specific spawning and rearing habitats are generally poorly known and increasingly uncommon in major rivers within its range.",,This species is characterized by olive to dark green on back and sides; shovel-shaped snout with large fleshy barbels; barbels usually closer to mouth than to snout tip; large bony scutes along back and sides (22-33 scutes along sides); 1 row of preanal scutes. The total length of individuals of this species may be up to 213 cm.,,,,,,Apparently this species spawns in the spring. Individuals become sexually mature at about 17 years (males) or approximately 21 years (females) (NMFS 2001). Females spawn at intervals of 3-7 years (NMFS 2001). Individuals live up to several decades.,,,,"Tagged green sturgeon from the Sacramento and Columbia Rivers are captured primarily in northern coastal and estuarine waters, with some fish tagged in the Columbia River recaptured as far north as British Columbia. While there is some bias associated with recovery of tagged fish through commercial fishing, the pattern of a northern migration is supported by the large concentration of green sturgeon peaking in the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor in August. These fish tend to be immature; however, mature fish and at least one ripe fish have been found in the lower Columbia River. Genetic evidence suggests that Columbia River green sturgeon are a mixture of fish from at least the Sacramento, Klamath, and Rogue Rivers. The reasons for the concentration of green sturgeon in Oregon and Washington estuaries during the summer are unknown as there is no known spawning in these rivers and all stomachs examined to date have been empty. See NMFS (2003) for specific sources of this information.",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature",Adults of this species feed on bottom invertebrates and small fish.,,,,,,,,,,,"The green sturgeon is comprised of two Distinct Population Segments (DPS) of which the southern Distinct Population Segment (sDPS) range in the western U.S. from California, in the lower Sacramento River primarily below the Red Bluff Diversion Dam, and occasionally in the lower Feather and Yuba Rivers (NMFS 2021). The northern Distinct Population Segment (nDPS) range includes the Klamath, Trinity, South Fork Trinity, and Eel Rivers (California) and the Rogue River (Oregon) (Israel et al 2009). Doukakis (2014) and Benson et al (2006) note occurrence of the green sturgeon nDPS in these rivers is limited to specific locations with suitable temperature and substrate habitat conditions suggesting limited occupancy. Total range extent, based on this description, and the definition of range extent for anadromous fish (includes spawning, rearing, and migration habitat) in Master et al. (2012), and using a GIS analysis, is about 2,000 km2 (Santos 2015a, 2015b).",,,,,,,"Hunting, K.",17-May-22,,

In the Fraser River (river km 98-181), British Columbia, six spawning sites were identified; five were within side channels of the meandering reach (km 98-143); one spawning site was in the main channel in the confined reach (km 145-181) (Perrin et al. 2003). In California and almost certainly in other occupied coastal rivers and streams, this species uses estuaries for significant parts of its life cycle. This species migrates upstream to spawn and moves back downstream when spawning is completed.","Although most British Columbia sturgeon live in large rivers, several populations are either restricted to large lakes or spend a certain amount of time within them. For example, certain individuals in the upper Kootenay River migrate to Kootenay Lake in the late autumn to spend the winter at great depths (Apperson and Anders 1991), and groups are often seen basking near the surface of Williams Lake or Stuart Lake in the spring (Cadden pers. comm. 1991, Legget, pers. comm. 1991). In the upper Kootenay River of B.C., Idaho and Montana, mature sturgeon utilized flowing water from 0.03 to 0.61 m/s, with a mode of 0.24 m/s (Apperson and Anders 1991). The same fish utilized depths of 3-30 m in the river, with a mode of 9 m; in Kootenay Lake they moved between 10 and 100.5 m, with a bimodal mode of about 55 and 90 m. Females used significantly deeper water than males during winter, and both sexes used significantly deeper water in winter than in spring or summer (Apperson and Anders 1991).","The largest North American freshwater fish; maximum length about 610 cm, maximum mass 1800 lbs (816 kg).",,,,,,"In the Columbia River, spawns May-July (Wydoski and Whitney 1979). In California, spawning apparently occurs between mid-March and early June (Moyle 1976). Spawning occurs at intervals of 4 to 11 years. Larvae hatch from eggs in 1-2 weeks. Males may reach sexual maturity in about 9 years, females in 13-16 years (Wydoski and Whitney 1979). May live over 100 years.",,,,"Some are anadromous and make extensive saltwater migrations. Many move more locally from estuaries to fresh water, or farther inland within fresh water, to spawn.",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","A bottom feeder. Young feed mostly on the larvae of aquatic insects, crustaceans, and molluscs. A significant portion of the diet of larger sturgeon consists of fish.",,,,,,,,,,,"This species inhabits fresh water riverine and estuarian waters from the Gulf of Alaska south to about Ensenada, Mexico and spawns in estuaries and other suitable habitat associated with major coastal rivers. This species may occur in landlocked populations spawning in river bottoms and freshwater estuaries or utilize the open western Pacific Ocean for accessing coastal estuaries. Spawning has been documented in the Fraser, Kootenay, and Upper Columbia Rivers (British Columbia, Canada), the Lower Columbia River (Washington and Oregon, USA) and Willamette River, (Oregon; pers. com., L. Heironimus 2024), the Kootenai River Basin (Idaho and Montana, USA), and the Sacramento, Feather, and occasionally San Joaquin Rivers (California, USA) (Moyle et al 2015). Current spawning is thought to be limited to the Fraser, Columbia, and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Systems (COSEWIC 2013, Dubois et al 2011). Using the Hammerson and Master (2009) method for determining Range Extent for freshwater and anadromous fish, this species likely occupies over 1,000,000 square kilometers in over 100 HUC 8 watersheds. Natureserve recognizes and maintains records for 6 populations of this species as defined by COSEWIC and the USFWS for conservation purposes. These populations are used for management and do not necessarily reflect genetic units. They are: Kootenai River in Idaho and Montana, USA (Pop 1; USFWS 1994), and the Upper Columbia River (Pop 2; COSEWIC 2013), the Nechako River (Pop 3; COSEWIC 2013), the Lower Fraser River (Pop 4; COSEWIC 2013), the Upper Fraser River (Pop 5; COSEWIC 2013), and Middle Fraser River (Pop 6; COSEWIC 2013), Canada.

Kootenai River locations are generally more than 6 m deep with flows 

Water depths of at least 5 meters, flows with a minimum mean water column velocity of at least 3.3 fps, stable, temperatures of roughly 50 F in May through July with no sudden drops in temperature exceeding 3.6 F, and rocky substrate for at least 5 miles are necessary for successful spawning that leads to recruitment into the adult population. Because the behavior of sturgeon results in spawning in areas that are not able to support egg incubation and embryo survival all three physical and biological components need to be present in the same place at the same time for successful spawning and recruitment (USFWS 2006).


","EGG: Kootenay white sturgeon eggs have been collected over shifting sand substrates (Rust et al. 2004) at depths ranging from 3 to 16 m and mean column velocities ranging from 0.15 to 1.32 m/s (Paragamian et al. 2003; Rust et al. 2004). LARVAL: Hatchery-released larval fish were collected mostly by surface nets in 2002 (Rust et al. 2004). JUVENILE: Hatchery-released juveniles have been observed to use shallow, weedy ledges (Vandenbos and Spence 2001) and areas within 700 m of Kootenay Lake shore (Neufeld and Spence 2004a); they have been observed in depths that range from 1 to 20 m (Vandenbos and Spence 2001, Neufeld and Spence 2002, 2004a). ADULTS: Deep portions of the Kootenay River and the south end of Kootenay Lake (Apperson and Anders 1990). Use different habitats seasonally (i.e., spawning; see movement/migration section). Two years of data suggested that adults may spend most of their time near the bottom, and when sturgeon are moving the most vertically in the water column, they are also exhibiting the most horizontal movement (Rust et al. 2004).","Sturgeons have cartilaginous skeletons with a persistent notochord, a protractile tube-like mouth, and sensory barbels on the underside of the snout. White sturgeons are large fishes with 11-14 dorsal, 36-48 lateral, and 9-12 ventral scutes (bony plates). Smaller than ocean-going populations, with no reports larger than 200 lbs from the Kootenai River.",,,"Population genetically defined based on differences in allele frequencies, genetic distance calculation, and overall amount of variation (Setter and Brannon 1990). Population was isolated by Bonnington Falls since the last glaciation (Neufeld & Spence 2004).",Adults captured from 1977 to 1997 ranged from 81 to 276 cm FL and from 4600 to 90900 g in weight (Fleck & Andrusak 1977; Andrusak 1982; Apperson and Anders 1990; R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1998b).,,"Breeding occurs during the period of peak flows in late spring and early summer, April or May through July (USFWS 1993). Spawning occurs when the physical environment permits eggs development and cues ovulation. Only part of the adult population breeds each year, with females spawning every 2-11 years. White sturgeons are broadcast spawners, releasing eggs and sperm in fast water. Following fertilization, the eggs adhere to the bottom substrate and hatch after 8-15 days (Brannon et al. 1985). Larval with yolk-sacs drift in the current for several hours, then settle into interstitial spaces in the substrate. Larvae metamorphose in 20-30 days, when they disperse into the river and begin to actively feed (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Females reach sexual maturity at 15-32 years, males sooner (Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission 1992).","Spawning not observed in BC. Spawning occurs in the Kootenai River near Bonners Ferry, ID (Paragamian et al. 2003). Estimated date of white sturgeon spawning events ranges from 6 May to 24 June (Paragamian et al. 2003); it is thought that spawning occurs when water temperatures increase and on the descending limb of the hydrograph (Rust et al. 2004). From 1994 to 2000, the number of spawning events ranged from 9 to 20, with spawning days ranging from 17 to 31 (Paragamian and Wakkinen 2002). White sturgeon aggregations in groups of 2 or 7 have been observed during the spawning season in the Kootenai River spawning area (Paragamian et al. 2003). The number of viable eggs collected during spawning studies conducted from 1994 to 2003 ranged from 57 in 1997 to 420 in 1998 (Paragamian and Wakkinen 2002; Rust et al. 2004).",Oldest of 342 captured in 1977-1982 was 44 years old (Partridge 1983).,"Decline in BC seems to be linked to changes in the Kootenay River's flow pattern resulting from completion of Libby Dam (Holton 1980; Apperson 1992; USFWS 1993). Recruitment failure also attributed to changes in habitats following construction of Libby Dam; dyking of side channels and sloughs, pollution from industrial and mining developments (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Juvenile population fluctuations as a result of yearly hatchery releases (Ireland et al. 2002; Paragamian et al. 2003; Rust et al. 2004). Paragamian et al. (2003) observed that when water temperatures drop by 0.8'C or more, adult white sturgeon stop spawning.","Land-locked; not anadromous. Individuals migrate freely from Kootenay Lake to the Kootenai River upstream into Montana (Andrusak 1980). In fall, migrates from lower river and Kootenay Lake, British Columbia, to staging reaches, then migrates in spring to the spawning reach near Bonners Ferry (Paragamian et al. 2001). During late summer and fall they move into the deepest holes in the Kootenai River and Kootenay Lake (Apperson and Anders 1990).","ADULTS: Movements within and between Canada and the United States are common (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Adults located in defined high and medium-use areas outside spawning season within Kootenay Lake (Creston Delta, Duncan Delta, Crawford Bay - Canada) and the Lower Kootenai River (US) (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Males have been observed to be more evenly distributed among high and medium-use areas in Kootenay Lake, where as females were primarily observed in the Creston Delta area (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Mature males and females were observed to move into a staging area (near Rock Creek, ID) prior to the spawning period (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). During the spawning period (i.e., 31 May to 31 June), mature fish were observed at Bonners Ferry, ID (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Post-spawned males were observed to move downstream from Bonners Ferry (ID) to Creston Delta (BC); a few males moved downstream to Duncan Delta (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Post-spawned females moved downstream to Creston Delta (BC), Duncan Delta (BC), or to the lower River (ID) (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Linear distance of all habitat segments used by Kootenay white sturgeon (Canada and US) was estimated to be approximately 100 km as measured from R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. (1999). JUVENILES: Based on hatchery-releases only, studies indicate both upstream and downstream movements occur (Neufeld and Spence 2004a, 2004b). The majority of sonic tagged juveniles moved","Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","A bottom feeder.

L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999). Chronimid larvae was the most abundant food type observed in the stomachs of hatchery-raised juvenile white sturgeon (Rust et al. 2004).",,,"Phenology information is specific for BC only. However, from early May to late June, mature fish have been observed to move upstream to Bonners Ferry, ID. Based on when sampling and telemetry studies were conducted, mature females may return to Kootenay Lake in July after spawning, whereas mature males may move here in July and August (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1999).",,,,,,,"Exists in only in 270 river kilometers (168 miles) of the Kootenai River from Kootenai Falls, Montana, downstream through Kootenay Lake to Corra Lynn Dam at the outflow from Kootenay Lake in British Columbia (USFWS 2001); this range includes Idaho as well as British Columbia and Montana; the population apparently does not commonly occur upstream of Bonners Ferry, Idaho (Apperson and Anders 1991). About 45 percent of the population's range is in British Columbia (USFWS 2001). Currently known to spawn only in a reach near Bonners Ferry, Idaho, 100 km downstream from Libby Dam (Paragamian et al. 2001). Of individuals tracked in 1989, at least 36 percent overwintered in Kootenay Lake (Apperson and Anders 1991). Bonnington Falls, a natural barrier downstream of Kootenay Lake, has isolated the Kootenay River population of white sturgeon for approximately 10,000 years, and the population is isolated from other populations downstream by Corra Lynn Dam (Apperson and Anders 1991). 

This population is one of 18 land-locked populations of white sturgeon known to occur in western North America (USFWS 1994). The Kootenai River originates in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia, flows south into Montana, turns northwest into Idaho, and north through the Kootenai Valley back into British Columbia, where it flows through Kootenay Lake and eventually joins the Columbia River at Castlegar, British Columbia.",,,,,,,"Reichel, J.

Spawning habitats were located near the Revelstoke Golf Course (approximately 5 km downstream of Revelstoke Dam); depths at egg collection sites ranged from 2 to 5 m (R. L. & L. Environmental Services 2000; Golder Associates Ltd. 2003a). Feeding areas were observed to be near or in the vicinity of tributaries (i.e., ~16 km upstream of Beaton Flats, ~25 km downstream of Revelstoke Dam (Big Eddy), Burton (95 km upstream from HLK dam), and Taite Creek (~67 km upstream from HLK dam) (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). TG: Adults selected 5 main areas with deeper mainstem habitats with low velocities: the area downstream from HLK; at the confluence of the Columbia-Kootenay rivers; Kootenay Eddy (lower Kootenay River below Brilliant Dam); Fort Shepherd Eddy (~53 km downstream of HLK dam); and Waneta Eddy (confluence with the Pend'Oreille River) (UCRWSRI 2002). These five high-use areas are most likely overwintering and feeding areas, since tagged individuals were observed in these areas during most of the year and no large migrations have been observed to date. Spawning habitats were located below Waneta Dam (Pend'Oreille - Columbia confluence); white sturgeon eggs were collected at depths from 2 to 14m (Golder Associates Ltd. 2004b). Stocked juvenile white sturgeon have been observed below HLK dam and in Waneta Eddy (Golder Associates Ltd. 2003b).",,,,,"Arrow Lakes Reservoir (ALR): Adults ranged from 127 to 242 cm fork length (FL) and from 1800 to 13800 g in weight (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). Transboundary Group (TG): Upper Columbia River White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative (UCRWSRI 2002) designates the group below Hugh L. Keenleyside (HLK) Dam to Canada-US border as the TG. Adults ranged from 69.4 to 280 cm FL and from 260 to 21000 g in weight (R. L. & L. Environmental Services 1994, 1998).",,,"Arrow Lakes Reservoir (ALR): Spawning has been documented only twice (1999 and 2003) within a 4 year study period (1999 - 2001, 2003) (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). Larvae (incubated in situ at 10.1C and 11.0C) (Tiley 2004) hatched within the time required for normal embryo development (Wang et al. 1985). Potential pre-spawning individuals moved to the spawning area between mid-June and July (water temperatures between 6 and 9 degrees Celcius) (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). Transboundary Group (TG): Spawning has been documented in the transboundary reach below Waneta Dam every year since studies began in 1993 (UCRWSRI 2002). The number of distinct spawning events has ranged from 4 in 1993 to 9 in both 1995 and 1996 (UCRWSRI 2002). In the Waneta spawning area, spawning events have occurred from early June through late July when temperatures were between 14 and 25 degrees Celcius. Incubated wild-caught eggs 'in situ' showed lower success at temperatures exceeding 18 degrees Celcius (UCRWSRI 2002). In the Columbia River population, mature males were observed to be smaller (106 to 207 cm FL) and younger (16 to 46 years) than females (137 to 271 cm FL; 27 to 65 years (UCRWSRI 2002). The UCRWSRI committee (2002) indicates that the female spawning interval in the upper Columbia River was much greater than the 3 years reported for the lower Columbia.",,"Arrow Lakes Reservoir (ALR): Dispersal distances observed for sonic tagged individuals were calculated as: i) average = 11.6 km (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005); ii) minimum = 0; and, iii) maximum = 182.8 km (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). ALR individuals may have access to larger group located below HLK through boat lock (vice versa), however occurrence of movements between these two locations is limited (R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). One tagged female was observed to move from Beaton Flats to below HLK dam in 1999; this individual was recorded in the same spot for over a year and was assumed to have died (R. L. & L. Environmental Services 2000). 
Transboundary Group (TG): Dispersal distances observed for sonic tagged individuals were calculated as: i) average = 4.4 km (Golder Associates Ltd. 2004); ii) minimum = 0; and, iii) maximum = 67.6 km. Previous observations recorded that 47.3% moved < 1 km from their original release location, 44.4% moved between 1 to 10 km, and 8.3% moved > 10 km (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1997). This group has access to habitats below the Canada-US border; there is some evidence that few individuals move downstream into this area (~70 km downstream) (Golder Associates Ltd. 2004). Recovery planning and initiatives for the transboundary population have been in place since 2000 (UCRWSRI 2002).",,"Arrow Lakes Reservoir (ALR): Movements have been observed in an approximate 163 km linear distance within ALR. Individuals are relatively inactive from October to March and usually remained in Beaton Flats (180 km upstream of Hugh L. Keenleyside (HLK) Dam) for overwintering purposes. Minimal movements were observed during the overwinter period (i.e., October to March) and tended to be only approximately 5 km from the Beaton Flats area (i.e., to Beaton Arm or Galena Bay). From March to early June, individuals moved to potential feeding areas (i.e., ~16 km upstream from Beaton Flats, 30 km downstream of Revelstoke Dam (Big Eddy), Burton (95 km upstream from HLK), and Taite Creek (67 km upstream from HLK)). In mid-June and July, mature white sturgeon were observed to move upstream to the tailrace of Revelstoke Dam for potential spawning (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). TG: The majority of movements have been observed in designated ""high-use"" areas having an approximate linear distance of 20.3 km (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1994). White sturgeon in the Transboundary Group (TG) are concentrated throughout the year in five deep, low velocity areas: the area downstream from HLK; at the confluence of the Columbia-Kootenay rivers); Kootenay Eddy (lower Kootenay River below Brilliant Dam); Fort Shepherd Eddy (~53 km downstream of HLK); and Waneta Eddy (confluence with the Pend'Oreille River) (UCRWSRI 2002). Defined seasonal migrations have not been observed, however, sturgeon have been noted to make localized movements between the high-use areas (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1997). More recent information indicates that mature males and females were observed at the Waneta spawning area during mid-June to July; some fish remained until August and moved between Fort Shepher Eddy (FSE) and Waneta Eddy (WE) (Golder Associates Ltd. 2004).",,,"Arrow Lakes Reservoir (ALR): Capture data indicates incidence of burbot by-catch during set lining for white sturgeon, therefore, burbot may be a potential food source (R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). Potential feeding areas identified included upstream of Beaton Flats, downstream of Big Eddy (~25 km downstream of Revelstoke Dam), Burton (~95 km upstream from HLK), and Taite Creek (~67 km upstream of HLK) (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). Transboundary Group (TG): Potential feeding areas may include the five high-use areas (see Subnational Habitat Comments), since tagged individuals were observed in these areas during most of the year and no large migrations have been observed to date (UCRWSRI 2002). Potential food resources may include Kokanee and Whitefish; these species are found in the transboundary reach and have been used as bait to capture white sturgeon (R. L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 1994). Also, during a necropsy, whole and partial Whitefish were found in the stomach contents of a white sturgeon that washed up below HLK dam (L. Porto, pers. comm.).",,,"The phenology depicts both white sturgeon groups in the Columbia River. Differences in phenology for the Arrow Lakes Reservoir (ALR) group includes i) the presence of Adults (A) in the 1st and 2nd half of June; ii) the presence of reproductive (R) individuals in the 1st half of July; and iii) the presence of embryos in August only. Whereas embryos have been observed in early June for the Transboundary Group (TG). ALR: October to early March, tagged individuals were observed to remain relatively inactive (i.e., overwintering period) (R. L. & L. Environmental Services 2000). From March to early June, tagged individuals were observed to move to feeding areas (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). From mid-June to July, tagged individuals were observed to move to the spawning area; eggs were usually collected from late July to late August (Golder Associates Ltd. 2005). TG: Mature males and females were observed at the WE spawning area during mid-June to July; some fish remained here until August and moved between Fort Shepherd Eddy (FSE) and Waneta Eddy (WE) (Golder Associates Ltd. 2004). Staging of pre-spawners may occur during November to late May in FSE, WE, and HLK dam (UCRWSRI 2002).",,,,,,,"As defined in this database, the riverine range includes spawning populations in the mainstem Columbia River from its mouth to its junction with the Kootenai River in British Columbia (also includes extreme lower reaches of major tributaries except the Snake and Kootenai rivers).",,,,,,,,,"Porto, L.

Lower velocity sections of depositional areas are distributed sporadically downstream to Yale. The Fraser River below Yale exhibits a low gradient braided channel with a prevalence of large sidechannels, marshes, and backwater sloughs. The substratum in this area is more depositional than in the Lower Canyon section, with higher concentrations of fine sediment and small gravel (R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). 
In the lower section of the river, Perrin et al. (1999, 2000) found evidence of spawning in sidechannels with substrates of gravel, cobble and sand; in the mainstem site boulder and cobble predominated; flows were mainly laminar with near-bed velocities averaging 1.7 m/s. Most eggs and larvae were collected at water depths between 3.0 and 4.5 m and at velocities of > 1.5 m/s for eggs, and 0.5 to 1.5 m/s for larvae. Juveniles (< 1 m in length) are often found in the lower reaches of tributaries, large backwaters, sidechannels and sloughs.",,,,"MtDNA research by Smith et al. (2002) identified two white sturgeon groups in the section of the Fraser River below the Nechako confluence. This Lower Fraser River population is found in the section below Hell's Gate; the other population, the Middle Fraser River, is found in the section below the Nechako confluence to Hell's Gate. Movements by a few individuals suggest there may be some genetic exchange (R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000).","Sturgeon have five rows of scutes, along their back and sides. The scutes are quite sharp when the fish are young but gradually wear down as they age. Sturgeon skeletons are cartilaginous except for small amounts of bone in the pelvic area, skull and jaw. They have no teeth but can extend their mouth to reach out and engulf food. Green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) are occasionally seen in the lower Fraser River; they have one row of 1 - 4 scutes between the pelvic and anal fins, while white sturgeon have two rows of 4 - 8 scutes.",,,Below Hell's Gate some females may spawn as young as 18 and males at 14 years of age (Semakula and Larkin 1968). Generation time appears to be around 30-35 years (COSEWIC 2003). Sex ratio was skewed to males 4-4.5:1 (R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). Adults survive spawning but do not spawn every year; the proportion of reproductively mature individuals in a given year is quite low; R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. (2000) found that fewer than 10% of the females and 12% of the males examined in the adult size class were in the late reproductive stages (n=117).,,"Fish between the ages of 6 to 20 were most commonly caught; the oldest was aged at 118 (R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). The largest fish captured was 343 cm (Nelson et al. 2004). Co-exists with many fish species including lampreys (Petromyzontidae), minnows (Cyprinidae), suckers (Catostomidae), smelts (Osmeridae), salmon, trout, char and whitefish (Salmonidae) and sculpins (Cottidae).",,"Not known to be anadromous. A study by Veinott et al. (1999) suggests that fish in the lower river rarely migrate to sea, although a proportion of juveniles spend extended periods in the estuary; after age 40 most are permanent residents of the river. May make extended migrations to spawning or holding sites (> 70 km) and also move to foraging and over-wintering sites (Nelson et al. 2004).",,,"Eat a variety of organisms from benthic invertebrates including crayfish, shrimp and clams to fish such as lamprey, salmon, eulachon and smelt (Semakula and Larkin 1968; Lane and Rosenau 1995, Echols 1995). Smaller sturgeon tend to eat smaller invertebrates, while larger sturgeon consume mainly fish including salmon and eulachon. Will readily take live prey as well as carcasses (Lane and Rosenau 1995).",,,"Generally dormant from October to March; begin to move to foraging areas in March; also move to spawning areas in spring to spawn during peak flows, then to over-wintering areas in the fall (RL&L Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). Studies by Perrin et al. (1999 and 2000) in the lower Fraser River indicate spawning occurs in the spring or early summer (May to July) at water temperatures between 11.3 and 18.4 degrees Celsius, either at the peak of the freshet or as flows decline.",,,,,,,"Fraser River, from confluence of the Nechako River at Prince George downstream to the mouth, British Columbia.",,,,,,,,,"Ptolemy, J.",15-Mar-05

The scutes are quite sharp when the fish are young but gradually wear down as they age. Sturgeon skeletons are cartilaginous except for small amounts of bone in the pelvic area, skull and jaw. They have no teeth but can extend their mouth to reach out and engulf food. This is the only sturgeon in the upper Fraser River.",,,"This is a slow growing population, likely due to a shorter growing season and differences in food resources (R.L. & L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000), as it occurs at the northern extent of the species range. The age of sexual maturity and the time between spawning events is likely increased relative to southern populations; it is also possible that the size at which sexual maturity is reached is much smaller and the average number of eggs carried by an individual is less than in more southern populations.",,"Fish between the ages of 6 to 20 were the most common in the catch; the oldest was aged at 93 (Yarmish and Toth 2002).

Burrowing habitat is typically well washed fine sand and fine gravel, free of mud, usually with a strong bottom current keeping oxygen levels high (Emmett et al. 1991). Sand lance distribution in Kodiak, Alaska, was associated with freshwater influence and not on beaches composed entirely of fine, hard packed sand (Dick and Warner1982). Prefer well-lighted habitat and are most common at depths less than 50 m, but may be found up to depths of 275 m. Feeding schools are found in littoral waters within proximity of burrowing habitat. Highest abundance found in burrowing habitat that is sheltered from onshore wave action and disturbance by winter storms (Robards et al. 2002).",,"A small coastal forage fish with an elongate, compressed body. Metallic blue dorsally and silver ventrally, this fish routinely burrows into several centimeters of sand or gravel substrate. Identifiable features include absence of teeth and swim bladder, deeply forked caudal fin, lateral line high on the body, small cycloid scales and long, slender gill rakers. This species has a single dorsal fin which folds back into a groove, and projecting premaxilla and lower jaw. A fleshy ridge extending the length of the body on either side of the ventral midline is also sometimes present (Mecklenburg et al. 2002).",,,,,,"Spawns intertidally and possibly subtidally once a year within proximity of burrowing habitat: in Alaska, from late August through October (Robards et al. 1999b); in Puget Sound, Washington, as late as mid February (Penttila 1997). Spawning has been documented in the same locations for decades (Robards et al. 1999b). Robards et al. (1999b) found age 1 (50%) and age 2 (31%) fish dominated spawning schools in the Gulf of Alaska and ages 3, 4, 5 and 6 made up 14, 4, 1 and < 1%, respectively, of the overall spawning school composition. Female fecundity is proportional to length, ranging from around 1,400 to 16,080 ova per female. Spawns vigorously in dense formations, leaving scoured pits in beach sediments. Slightly adhesive eggs are deposited in the intertidal zone just below the water line, and in some areas of Alaska in the subtidal zone (McGurk and Warburton 1992). Embryos develop in up to 67 days, often through periods of intertidal exposure and sub-freezing air temperatures (Robards et al. 1999d).",,"Considered a key prey species for many marine predators including birds, fishes and mammals because of its high energy content (Mabry 2000). Predators include commercially valued species such as halibut (Hippoglossus spp.), rockfish (Sebastes spp.) and salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) as well as seabirds such as the Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and Red-throated Loon (Gavia stellata) and marine mammals including the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (Field 1987). The recovery of a Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba) colony in Prince William Sound, Alaska, appears to be limited by the availability of sand lance (Golet et al. 2002). Sand lance availability may also affect the reproductive output of Common Murres (Uria aalge) (Piatt and Anderson 1996). This euryhaline and eurythermic species has a short life span (up to 7 yrs), a large number of predators, and probably has correspondingly high rates of mortality, growth and fecundity (Fritz et al. 1993). Defense tactics used against predation include burrowing into soft, wet sand in the intertidal/subtidal zones and contraction of the fish school into a ball of closely packed fish (Robards et al. 1999d).",,"Spawning appears to occur within habitat occupied by this species year-round, and no spawning migrations have been observed; however, offshore-onshore movements occur before spawning in the fall (Robards et al. 1999d). Exhibits high site fidelity to spawning locations, although eggs and larvae are subject to limited movement by water currents and tides.",,,"Larvae feed on phytoplankton and early zooplankton stages. Adults feed in large schools, consuming mainly copepod zooplankton within relatively short distances of fish burrowing habitat (Hobson 1986). Epibenthic invertebrates become more important in diet during autumn and winter. Adults also feed on herring (Clupea harengus) larvae and eggs, and may feed in mixed aggregations with herring and Pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) (Sturdevant et al. 2000).",,,"Feeds and schools diurnally and burrows nocturnally into sand substrate; also burrows into substrate to pass the winter in a dormant state. Spawning occurs during night and day, between August and February, throughout the species' range.",,,,,,,,Throughout the coastal North Pacific; in the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk in the western North Pacific and the Beaufort Sea south to Balboa Island (near Baja California) in the eastern North Pacific.,,,,,,,"Gotthardt, T.

Sometimes spawning occurs on lake shoals, beaches, or river mouths (areas with wave action). Eggs sink and usually stick to and become lodged in gravel.",,"Almost cylindrical body; rounded snout barely projects beyond upper lip when viewed from below; large horizontal mouth; thick lips (lower lip about twice as thick as upper lip); lower lip with deep notch in middle; 0-3 rows of papillae at middle of lower lip, 2-6 rows of papillae on upper lip; fewer than 75 scales in lateral series; brownish to blackish back becomes gold in breeding male, which also often has a scarlet stripe on each side. Juveniles often have three or more dark blotches on their sides (as do some adults). Total length up to 64 cm.

See Snyder and Muth (1990) for a guide to the identification of larvae and early juveniles.",,,,,,"Spawning occurs usually in spring (or early summer in the far north). Eggs sink and usually stick to and become lodged in gravel. Eggs hatch in 5-15 days, depending on temperature. Individuals become sexually mature in 3-8 years, depending on locality; males mature at a younger age than do females (Becker 1983, Scott and Crossman 1973).

Probably it seeks off-channel backwaters during high streamflows in winter and spring (Wydoski and Whitney 2003).

Within streams, this fish is most abundant in headwater reaches, which have slightly cooler summer water temperatures and slightly higher average gradients than do lower areas. Salish suckers tend to be associated with long, continuous areas of deep pool habitat, with suitable riffles for spawning (Pearson and Healey 2003). Accordingly, critical habitat for Salish sucker in British Columbia includes all reaches in occupied streams with more than 50 meters of continuous pool with a water depth exceeding 70 cm at summer low flows (Recovery Team for Salish Sucker 2010). Spawning sites in British Columbia creeks were at riffles with fine gravel bottoms. Eggs lodge and adhere in gravel crevices (Wydoski and Whitney 2003).",Found only in streams in British Columbia.,,,,,,,"Spawning in British Columbia was observed from early April through mid-June or early July (Pearson and Healey 2003). Wydoski and Whitney (2003) stated that spawning in British Columbia occurs in March or April when water temepratures reach 45-46 F and that some individuals in spawning condition have been caught through late August, when water temperatures were 68 F or higher. In Washington, spawning has been observed as early as early March. Individuals first spawn at the end of their second year (McPhail 1987). Life span is only 4-5 years in British Columbia (McPhail 1987, Inglis et al. 1992), but older individuals are known from Washington (McPhail 1987).",,"In British Columbia, the species typically co-occurs with juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), cutthroat trout (O. clarki) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). All of these species are capable of being significant predators of young Salish suckers (McPhail 1987).",,"Breeding adults congregate at distinct spawning sites in creeks; very short movements may be involved. However, some individuals may move more than 1 km and cross multiple beaver dams en route (though many radio-tagged individuals never crossed a beaver dam) (Pearson and Healey 2003).

In Pepin Brook, British Columbia, radio-tracked individuals used 42-307 m of linear channel and areas of 212-1,704 sq m (95% home range size); 100% home range size ranged up to 497 m and 7,008 sq m (Pearson and Healey 2003).",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature","The diet of adults appears to consist largely of chironomid midge larvae; the diet of the young is unknown (McPhail 1987). Overall, the diet likely includes various invertebrates such as aquatic insect larvae, crustaceans, mollusks (primarily snails), worms, and occasionally fish eggs (Wydoski and Whitney 2003).",,,,,,,,,,,"This sucker is known from several river systems in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia and in the Puget Sound lowlands of Washington (Wydoski and Whitney 2003). Current information suggests that approximately 25% of the global range and 70% of all populations are in Canada (Recovery Team for Salish Sucker 2010). 

In Canada, the Salish sucker has been observed in eleven watersheds: (1) Little Campbell River (extirpated), (2) Salmon River, (3) Bertrand Creek, (4) Pepin Brook, (5) Fishtrap Creek, (6) Salwein Creek/Hopedale Slough, (7) Atchelitz/Chilliwack/Semmihault creeks, (8) Elk Creek/Hope Slough, (9) Mountain Slough, (10) Agassiz Slough, and (11) Miami Creek (Recvoery Team for Salish Sucker 2010).

In Washington, the range includes three lakes and a slough draining into Puget Sound, and the Skagit, Nooksack, and Green River drainages (COSEWIC 2002); specifically, Whatcom Lake, the Skagit River system (including the Sauk and Suiattle rivers, the Stillaguamish River system (including Twin, Chitwood, and Trout lakes), Deep Creek (a tributary of the Snohomish River system), the Green River system, and Lake Cushman (a part of the Skokomish River system (Hallock, pers. comm., 2000, cited by Wydoski and Whitney 2003).",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",22-Jun-11,"CANNINGS, S.G.",30-Oct-91

(1990) and Gach (1996), though the apparent native status in eastern Colorado (Woodling 1985) suggests that the New Mexico population could be native. Brook sticklebacks have been introduced in various places south of the native range, such as in Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, northwestern Colorado, northeastern Utah (Modde and Haines 1996, Great Basin Nat. 56:281), and California. Present distribution was influenced by postglacial dispersal from separate refugia in the Mississippi and Ohio river basins (Gach 1996).",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",15-Nov-11,,

Tolerant of wide range in oxygen, salinity, turbidity, and bottom conditions. Fry, juveniles, and adults tolerate temperatures between 5 and 35 C; optimal growth occurs between 25 and 30 C (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Carp can live in water with turbidities in excess of 200 JTU and secchi disc visibilities less than 8 cm (3.2 in) (Jester 1974). A pH level greater than 10.5 or less than 5.0 is harmful (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Air gulping occurs when dissolved oxygen (DO) level is less than 0.5 mg/l; 6-7 mg/l DO is needed for optimum growth (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Some carp occur in areas with water currents as swift as 120 cm/sec, but much slower waters are preferred, such as less than 20 cm/sec in the Missouri River (Edwards and Twomey 1982). 

Optimal river habitat is characterized by warm water (above 20 degrees C during the growing season, about mid-June through August), low gradient (above 1.5 m/km), shallow vegetated marshland available for spawning, at least 50% of the river area in pools or off-channel areas, adequate cover (logs, brush, etc.) in pools, and fertile conditions. 

Optimal lake habitat has warm water (as defined above), at least 25% littoral area, aquatic or inundated vegetation for spawning, deeper waters for overwintering, and fertile conditions (Edwards and Twomey 1982). In winter, carp may occur in deeper water than used in summer. In Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, adults spent the summer in 3-4 ft (0.9-1.2 m) of water and moved to 4-8 ft (1.2-2.4 m) in the winter (Otis and Weber 1982). Carp spent the winter in 5-7 m of water in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (Johnson and Hasler 1977). 

Usually, carp spawn in shallows and flooded areas in water depths of less than 0.5 m, but spawning has been observed in 1.8 m deep water (Edwards and Twomey 1982). Eggs are scattered and stick to submerged objects. Carp fry stay attached to the vegetation for about two days before dropping to the bottom, and they inhabit shallow (less than 2 m), warm sluggish water during their first summer (Edwards and Twomey 1982).",,"From Scott and Crossman (1973), Jester (1974), and Pflieger (1975): adult length 12-25 in (30.5-63.5 cm) or more; large individuals may reach 20-60 lbs (9.1-27.2 kg); two barbels on each side of upper jaw, posterior pair more conspicuous; relatively small, toothless mouth, with the upper jaw slightly protruding; throat teeth 1,1,3-3,1,1, with teeth in main row broad and molar-like; lateral line complete, with 35 to 38 scales; one long dorsal fin with 17-21 soft rays, and a stout saw-toothed spine in front of dorsal and anal fins; pectoral fins with 14-17 rays; pelvic fins thoracic, originating beneath origin of dorsal fin, 8 or 9 rays; 1 anal fin with 5 branched rays; scales cycloid, large, thick; 35-36 vertebrae; 21-27 gill rakers on first gill arch; color variable: back and sides olivaceous, gold, greenish-olive, reddish-brown, or blackish-red, silver or yellowish-white below; fins dusky, often with red on tail fin and yellow or orange on lower fins; peritoneum gray, often more or less speckled.",,,,,,"Spawning occurs in spring and summer. Optimal water temperature for spawning is 18-22 C, although spawning can occur at water temperatures of 16-26 C (Shields 1957, Sigler 1958, Swee and McCrimmon 1966, Jester 1974). In South Dakota, a combination of rapidly rising water levels that inundated spawning areas and water temperatures above 62 F (16.5 C) were the primary stimulants for spawning (Shields 1957). Carp spawn from April through early August in Wisconsin (Miller 1952), mid-May through early August in Ontario (Swee and McCrimmon 1966), and late March through early fall in Missouri (Pflieger 1975) and New Mexico (Jester 1974). 

The spawning act begins by the segregation of carp into small groups of 4-20 individuals, led by a large female. With their backs and dorsal fins sticking above the water, the female broadcasts her eggs while swimming and splashing and several males release milt into the water. The sticky eggs adhere to plants, logs, and rocks and harden in 15-25 minutes. In Ontario, 90% of the eggs attached to vegetation were fertile (Swee and McCrimmon 1966). The average number of eggs per female in New Mexico is 47,134 (Jester 1974) and 902,942 in Ontario (Swee and McCrimmon 1966). There is a direct relationship between the number of eggs produced and the length (and age) of the female. Very large (19.1-23.3 lbs, 8.7-10.1 kg) and old (16-18 years) females can produce 1-2 million eggs (Swee and McCrimmon 1966, Jester 1974). Many females retain as much as 20% of their eggs for a second spawn, and males spawn with several females throughout the season (Swee and McCrimmon 1966). 

The eggs hatch in 3-16 days, depending on the water temperature, and the newly hatched fry are approximately 3 mm long (Swee and McCrimmon 1966). 

The age of sexual maturity varies with water temperature. Males become sexually mature at 2-3 years in Wisconsin, South Dakota, and New Mexico, and at 3-4 years in Ontario (Threinen 1949, Shields 1957, Swee and McCrimmon 1966, Jester 1974). Females mature approximately one year later. 

In Elephant Butte Lake, New Mexico, carp had an average life span of 1.3 years (Jester 1974). The maximum lifespan for males appears to be 8-10 years and 16-18 years for females (Swee and McCrimmon 1966, Jester 1974).",,"Carp have well-defined home ranges in both summer and winter but do not use the same ranges from season to season or from year to year (Otis and Weber 1982). In Wisconsin, winter home ranges, were one-third the size of summer ranges, and most of the everyday activities occurred in an area encompassing about 45% of the home range (Otis and Weber 1982). 

Extensive movements sometimes occur. In a mark-recapture study in Missouri, 51.3% of the carp were recaptured within 1 mile of their release site and 90% stayed within 25 miles, but one individual was recaptured over 200 miles away (Funk 1955). In a Wisconsin lake, most anchor-tagged carp were recaptured within 2 miles of their release site, but one carp moved 7.5 miles (12.1 km) in 18 days and one was recaptured 19.5 miles (31.4 km) away after 72 days (Otis and Weber 1982). A carp tagged near Columbia, Missouri, was recaptured 28 months later in South Dakota, a distance of 676 stream miles (1090 km) (Pflieger 1975). 

Adult carp have few enemies except humans; some juveniles are prey for predatory fishes, birds, and mammals. Sometimes, in shallow lakes and ponds, large numbers are killed by severe winter conditions (Shields 1957, Jessen and Kuehn 1958, Threinen 1949). Large-scale destruction of eggs occurs when water levels drop after the major spring spawning period, exposing and desiccating millions of eggs (Shields 1957, Sigler 1958).",,,,"Herbivore: Adult, Immature; Invertivore: Adult, Immature","Omnivorous; adults eat mainly invertebrates, detritus, fish eggs, and plant material (Jester 1974, Becker 1983, Sublette et al. 1990). Fry feed on zooplankton, such as cladocerns and COPEPOD NAUPLII (Buckley et al. 1976) but eat phytoplankton if zooplankton densities are low (Edwards and Twomey 1982). 

Most stomach analyses indicate that adults eat more animal matter than plant material (Moen 1953, Sigler 1958). Carp from several northwest Iowa lakes had an average of 10% plant material (debris, dead plant material, green fragments of pondweeds and filamentous algae, seeds of aquatic plants) and 90% animal material (midge larvae, caddisfly larvae, and other insect larvae, small crustaceans, small gastropods) (Moen 1953). In contrast, in Elephant Butte Lake, New Mexico, carp stomach contents contained 43.5% plant material and 10.2% animal material, with the rest of the food being unrecognizable (Jester 1974). The clorophyta and chrysophyta plant phyla made up 32.5% of all the plant material; copepods and cladocerans were the predominant animal items. 

Carp have been accused of eating large quantities of native fish eggs, but in both the Iowa and New Mexico, less than 1% of the food was fish eggs. 

In winter, carp eat considerably less food than in the summer. In Iowa, all of the stomach material examined from fish in winter was animal matter, principally crustaceans and midge larvae (Moen 1953). 

Foraging occurs on the bottom, on submerged objects, or at the surface (Jester 1974). When bottom feeding, carp swim slowly and steadily, in a head-down oblique position, with the mouth protruded, sucking up material and occasionally expelling it into the water column to pick out food items. Carp also ""fan"" the silt around rooted aquatic plants with their fins to uncover food items around the roots, and they sometimes pull up rooted vegetation for eating or uncovering food (Owen et al. 1981). Surface feeding is accompanied by a great deal of splashing and jumping from the water (Jester 1974).",,,,,,,,,,,"Native to temperate Eurasia; has been domesticated and selectively bred for human food for several centuries in Asia and Europe. The first stockings of carp in the United States occurred around 1872 and for the next 25 years the fish were stocked throughout the United States (Lachner et al. 1970, Phillips et al. 1982). At first, carp were a popular game and food fish, but by the turn of the century, the fish had become so well established and abundant in many waterways that stocking programs were discontinued. Carp are now found in every state except Hawaii and Alaska, in five Canadian provinces, and on every continent except Antarctica (Scott and Crossman 1973, Jester 1974, Edwards and Twomey 1982).",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",11-Dec-95,,

No Vancouver lampreys have been found more than a few hundred meters upstream of the lake in the few creeks that have been examined (Beamish 1984, 1987). Ammocoetes burrow in silt, mud, or sand in quiet water (Page and Burr 1991).

Spawning has been observed at the mouth of several creeks, where the adults aggregate in shallow, gravel-bottomed areas. Spawning may also occur in deeper water that is not easily examined (Beamish 1984, 1987).","Lives in two oligotrophic freshwater lakes: one 34 km long with a mean depth of 51 m and a maximum depth of 150 m; the other 7 km long with a surface area of approximately 59 hectares. None have been found more than a few hundred metres upstream of the lake in the few creeks that have been examined (Beamish 1987, 2001). Aggregates and spawns in shallow gravely areas located in the lakes or at the mouths of tributaries. Potential spawning habitat ranged from 20 cm to more than 2 m in depth; however, the full range of depth utilized was not determined as areas more than 15 cm deep were not easily studied (Beamish 1987, 2001).",,,,"This is a freshwater derivative of the anadromous Pacific lamprey, Lampetra tridentata, and thus belongs to the Lampetra species group that has been placed in the genus Entosphenus by other authors.","Differs from L. tridentata by its smaller size, larger oral disc, larger eyes, and longer prebranchial length (Beamish 1982). However, the primary differences are ecological and physiological. L. macrostoma spends its entire life within a lake and never enters salt water; L. tridentata, although it spends its larval life in fresh water, migrates to salt water to pass its adult life, re-entering fresh water only to breed. In laboratory studies, postlarval L. macrostoma survived in fresh water while all attempts to maintain L. tridentata were unsuccessful. There are no geographical barriers keeping the species separated, but their spawning seasons may be separated, L. tridentata spawning earlier than L. macrostoma. It is also possible that L. tridentata may spawn exclusively in streams while L. macrostoma spawns in lakes. More studies are needed to determine if this is so (Beamish 1982).",,"Reproductive males and females aggregate at spawning areas in the lake, generally at the mouths of creeks, from May to August. Spawning behavior as observed in the laboratory is similar to that reported for LAMPETRA RICHARDSONI and L. TRIDENTATA. Larval lamprey have been found in the gravel in the lake in the vicinity of creeks and occasionally in creeks, but always close to the lake. They probably remain in the larval stage for six years. They metamorphose into young adults from July to October but probably remain in the gravel until the spring of the following year. Spawning occurs the following year, that is, two years after metamorphosis. Like all lake lamprey, LAMPETRA MACROSTOMA breeds only once (Beamish 1984, 1987, 2001).","Spawning behaviour as observed in the laboratory is similar to that reported for Lampetra richardsoni and L. tridentata.

No LAMPETRA TRIDENTATA adults or larvae have been found in the same areas as this species. LAMPETRA TRIDENTATA do occur in the river flowing out of Cowichan Lake, but it is not known if they occur in the lake.

Freshwater-resident populations exist in several areas in British Columbia (McPhail 2007) and elsewhere.

Ammocoetes inhabit shallow backwater and eddy areas along edges of streams in mud, silt and sand (Lee et al. 1980). In southern California, adults apparently spend approximately one year in fresh water prior to spawning (Chase 2001).

Adults spawn in runs and riffles in rock-, sand-, or gravel-bottomed clear streams, in small, shallow depressions, or crude nests, at the heads of riffles (Wydoski and Whitney 1979). Water depth at spawning sites often is 30-150 cm (Moyle 2002).

Lake populations in British Columbia spawn at creek mouths or sometimes move up to a few hundred meters up creeks (Beamish 1987). The Goose Lake, California, population spawns in gravel riffles of tributary streams, far enough upstream such that there is adequate ammocoete habitat (muddy backwaters) downstream from the breeding area (Moyle et al. 1989).",,,,,,,,"The timing of migration to spawning stream varies geographically, and different runs may occur in a single river system. According to Wydoski and Whitney (1979) spawning occurs in June-July in Washington. In southern California, spawning likely begins by late January in most years, and spawning may continue into April (Chase 2001). In the Santa Clara River in southern California, upstream migration began as early as mid-December or as late as mid-March; peak migration occurred in March in most years (Chase 2001). Eggs hatch in 2 or 3 weeks. Ammocoetes remain in stream, metamorphose in 4-6 years (late September-October). Form macrostoma in British Columbia: spawns May-August, probably spends 6 years as larva and 2 years as subadult-adult before reproducing; metamorphosis July-October (Beamish 1987). Oceanic phase apparently may last 3-4 years in British Columbia but may be shorter in more southern areas (Moyle 2002). Generation time is 9 years (Luzier et al. 2011).

This is the only species of lamprey in which some individuals (from Washington) are known to spawn more than once (Page and Burr 1991).

See Luzier et al. (2011) for an up-to-date review of Pacific lamprey life history.",,,,"This species is mainly anadromous; newly metamorphosed individuals migrate from parent streams to the Pacific Ocean. Upstream migrations may be as long as several hundred kilometers. Land-locked populations omit the oceanic phase but migrate between lakes and spawning streams. Goose Lake, California, population migrates up to 20-30 km between the lake and tributary streams. See reproduction comments for further information.",,"Herbivore: Adult, Immature; Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","Adults parasitic on fishes; attach and feed on body fluids. Parasitic stage may last 20-40 months (Lee et al. 1980) (probably 1-2 years in Goose Lake, California, population: Moyle et al. 1989). Ammocoetes (larvae) are filter feeders; feed on microscopic plant and animal material.",,,Adults die soon after spawning.,,,,,,,,"Pacific lampreys occur in rivers around the North Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido, Japan (Yamazaki et al. 2005), to Alaska (Cape Lisburne and Norton Sound; apparently rare north of the Alaska Peninsula) and south to southern Baja California (Luzier et al. 2011). Malibu Creek, Los Angeles County, seems to be the southernmost point of regular occurrence in California; scattered distribution south of San Luis Obispo County, with regular runs in the Santa Clara River (Moyle 2002). Adults are wide-ranging in the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Baja California. Landlocked populations occur in lakes or reservoirs in British Columbia, Oregon, California, and possibly elsewhere.

At least historically, Pacific lampreys penetrated far inland in the Fraser, Columbia (to Idaho), Klamath-Trinity, Eel, and Sacramento-San Joaquin rivers. Dams now block or inhibit upstream passage in many rivers.",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",23-Feb-12,,

Nest are constructed in dense vegetation, often Chara beds (McPhail 1994), and are difficult to find; tend to nest in deeper water than limnetics, usually at a depth < 2 m (Hatfield 2001).",,,,"The Emily Lake, Priest Lake, and Balkwill Lake sticklebacks (limnetic and benthic) were subsumed into the Vananda Creek Sticklebacks (limnetic and benthic). The 3 are all found in the same watershed on Texada Island and preliminary molecular genetic data suggested that each of the 3 lakes are genetically similar to one another (Hatfield 2001). Other work has indicated that Priest Lake benthics are different from Emily Lake benthics (Taylor and McPhail 1999).","In each of the lakes the benthic stickleback has a robust body form, wide gape and few, short gill rakers (Hatfield 2001).",,,"Not well studied in this watershed, but benthics generally live longer and reproduce less frequently than limnetics; they do not seem to mature until their second year, and may live as long as seven years; females probably produce only one or two clutches per season regardless of food availability (Hatfield 2001).",,"Coexist with a limnetic stickleback (Gasterosteus sp. 16) and numerous invertebrates that feed on young sticklebacks; piscivorous birds including herons (Ardea herodias), kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon) and loons (Gavia immer); and cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) (Hatfield 2001).The two forms of sticklebacks differ in ecology (foraging strategy, behaviour, habitat choice).",,Balkwill and Priest lakes are joined by a marsh that may be passable during high water; Emily Lake is about 1 km downstream of Priest Lake (Hatfield 2001). In the spring limnetics move into the littoral zone to spawn; after spawning they return to the pelagic zone; by mid fall they are found in deeper water where they remain for the winter (Hatfield 2001).,,,"Not well studied but generally benthics feed on snails, clams, dragonfly nymphs, amphipods (Gammerus) and chironomids; likely feed on similar items throughout their life selecting larger prey as they grow; juvenile benthics feed in the shallow littoral zone within cover provided by vegetation or nearby (Hatfield 2001).",,,"Not well studied, but based on studies at Paxton Lake, males establish territories and build nests from April to early July; in the winter benthics are found in deeper water on the lake bottom (Hatfield 2001) and may be less active.",,,,,,,"This species is endemic to British Columbia, restricted to three small, interconnected lakes along the coast (COSEWIC 2010).

At high water, terrestrial plants dominate the littoral cover, but at lower levels the littoral regions may be covered by aquatic vegetation (predominantly Chara), leaves, marl, or ooze. The lake is dammed and the water was used in the past for mining, resulting in severe drawdowns (Larson 1976); however, the mine is closed and water extractions have ceased (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001). Maximum water temperature is about 23 C; a thermocline develops between 2 and 5 m in the summer. Hydrogen sulphide detected below 7 m in summer 1969.

Nests of limnetic sticklebacks often occur in water < 1 m deep on submerged logs, in shallow bays with gravel or rocky substrates, or on firm muddy substrate (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001).",,,,"The taxonomy of Gasterosteus is in chaos (Hagen and McPhail 1970) and neither the geographic boundaries nor the morphological limits of the nominate species Gasterosteus aculeatus are clear (McPhail 1989). The benthic and limnetic forms of stickleback in Paxton Lake breed true and apparently do not represent a foraging polymorphism; the two forms behave as biological species, though there is evidence of gene flow in the past and they probably retain the capacity to exchange genes; the genetic distance between the two forms indicates that divergence is recent; both forms fall well within the morphological boundaries of the widespread species G. aculeatus, complicating taxonomic conclusions (McPhail 1992). There are sticklebacks intermediate between benthic and limnetic forms, but these are not abundant. More study is required before these species can be given formal taxonomic names (McPhail 1989). Recent mitochondrial DNA studies (Taylor and McPhail 1999) support the hypothesis of evolution by sympatric divergence in Paxton Lake stickleback, and that limnetic-benthic species pairs have evolved independently in each lake where they occur.","Differs from the benthic form in Paxton Lake in being more slim-bodied, with a narrower mouth, more numerous and longer gill rakers, and normal lateral plates, dorsal spines, and pelvic girdle (McPhail 1992).",,Males establish territories and build nests from April to early July (Larson 1976).,Limnetics are generally sexually mature after one year and rarely live longer than two years; fecundity is about 30-40 eggs per clutch; females can produce several clutches in a season when food availability is high (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001). Reproductive males are larger on average than gravid females (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001).,"Coexists in the lake with a benthic stickleback (GASTEROSTEUS SP 5), cutthroat trout (SALMO CLARKI) and coho salmon (ONCORHYNCHUS KISUTCH). The latter were introduced (5000 fingerlings) in 1968. The two forms of sticklebacks in Paxton Lake differ in ecology (foraging strategy, behavior, habitat choice). Benthic sticklebacks are larger and more aggressive than limnetics and frequently chase them, forcing them to seek refuge above the CHARA. In certain types of shore cover, limnetics are aggressive, setting up small territories in the shadiest areas. When distribuited above CHARA, however, limnetics are not aggressive and do not establish territories (Larson 1976). Cutthroat trout were almost completely extirminated when the lake was drawn down to 11 m in 1957. By 1971 the planted coho salmon had reached lengths of 34 cm and sticklebacks were the predominant prey (Larson 1976).","Coexists in the lake with a benthic stickleback (Gasterosteus sp. 5) and small numbers of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki).

In certain types of shore cover, limnetics are aggressive, setting up small territories in the shadiest areas. When distributed above Chara, however, limnetics are not aggressive and do not establish territories (Larson 1976). Cutthroat trout have been almost completely eliminated by the construction of an outlet dam that prevents spawning (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001).

At high water, terrestrial plants dominate the littoral cover, but at lower levels the littoral regions may be covered by aquatic vegetation (predominantly CHARA), leaves, marl, or ooze. The lake is dammed and the water is used for industrial purposes, resulting in annual drawdowns of about 2.75 m (Larson 1976). Maximum temperature of about 23 C; thermocline between 2 and 5 m in the summer. Hydrogen sulphide detected below 7 m in summer 1969. Small benthic sticklebacks (","A small, 17 ha lake with a maximum depth of about 15 m. At high water, terrestrial plants dominate the littoral cover, but at lower levels aquatic vegetation (predominantly Chara), leaves, marl, or ooze cover this area. The lake is dammed and the water was used in the past for mining, resulting in severe drawdowns (Larson 1976); however, the mine is closed and water extractions have ceased (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001). Maximum water temperature is about 23 C; thermocline occurs between 2 and 5 m in the summer. Small benthic sticklebacks (Chara; and small groups were observed near sunken logs. In 1970, benthics were in shallower water than in 1969, and most were associated with cover on the bottom (Larson 1976). Nests of benthic sticklebacks occur in cover in the littoral zone (Larson 1976).",,,,"The taxonomy of Gasterosteus is in chaos (Hagen and McPhail 1970) and neither the geographic boundaries nor the morphological limits of the nominate species Gasterosteus aculeatus are clear (McPhail 1989). The benthic and limnetic forms of stickleback in Paxton Lake breed true and apparently do not represent a foraging polymorphism; the two forms behave as biological species, though there is evidence of gene flow in the past and they probably retain the capacity to exchange genes; the genetic distance between the two forms indicates that divergence is recent; both forms fall well within the morphological boundaries of the widespread species G. aculeatus, complicating taxonomic conclusions (McPhail 1992). There are sticklebacks intermediate between benthic and limnetic forms, but these are not abundant. More study is required before these species can be given formal taxonomic names (McPhail 1989). Recent mitochondrial DNA studies (Taylor and McPhail 1999) support the the hypothesis of evolution by sympatric divergence in Paxton Lake stickleback, and that limnetic-benthic species pairs have evolved independently in each lake where they occur.","Differs from the limnetic form in Paxton Lake in being larger (up to 90 mm SL), with a stouter body, wider mouth, fewer and shorter gill rakers, and a greatly reduced number of lateral plates and dorsal spines; entire pelvic girdle is absent in about 80% of adults (McPhail 1992).",,Males establish territories and build nests from April to early July (Larson 1976).,"Benthics generally live longer and reproduce less frequently than limnetics; they do not seem to mature until their second year, and may live as long as seven years (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001). Females often carry > 150 eggs and probably produce only one or two clutches per season regardless of food availability (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001).","Coexists in the lake with a limnetic stickleback (GASTEROSTEUS SP 4), cutthroat trout (SALMO CLARKI) and coho salmon (ONCORHYNCHUS KISUTCH). The latter were introduced (5000 fingerlings) in 1968. The two forms of sticklebacks in Paxton Lake differ in ecology (foraging strategy, behavior, habitat choice). Benthic sticklebacks are larger and more aggressive than limnetics and frequently chase them, forcing them to seek refuge above the CHARA. In certain types of shore cover, limnetics are aggressive, setting up small territories in the shadiest areas (Larson 1976). The presence of the two species is thought to be the result of a double invasion of the lake by marine sticklebacks, followed by trophic character displacement (McPhail 1992). Cutthroat trout were almost completely extirminated when the lake was drawn down to 11 m in 1957. By 1971 the planted coho salmon had reached lengths of 34 cm and sticklebacks were the predominant prey (Larson 1976).","Coexists in the lake with a limnetic stickleback (Gasterosteus sp. 4) and small numbers of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). The two forms of sticklebacks in Paxton Lake differ in ecology (foraging strategy, behaviour, habitat choice). Benthic sticklebacks are larger and more aggressive than limnetics and frequently chase them, forcing them to seek refuge above the Chara. In certain types of shore cover, limnetics are aggressive, setting up small territories in the shadiest areas (Larson 1976). Cutthroat trout have been almost completely eliminated by the construction of an outlet dam that prevents spawning (Hatfield and Ptolemy 2001). Coho salmon (O. kisutch) were released in the lake in 1968, but this has not been continued and they no longer occur here.",,Move to deeper water to overwinter.,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature","Littoral, benthic forager (McPhail 1992); feeds mainly on amphipods (GAMMARUS), midge larvae (Chironomidae), and ostracods.

Ammocoetes burrow in sandy-muddy backwaters of streams. Adults are anadromous, feeding in estuaries and at sea and spawning over gravel riffles in clear freshwater streams (Lee et al. 1980). In British Columbia, just prior to metamorphosis, congregates immediately upriver of salt water, enters ocean from May to July (Beamish and Youson 1987). Adults probably spend much of their life in estuaries (Moyle et al. 1989). Spawning occurs in small, clean tributary streams, over gravel riffles, probably in saucer-shaped nests, dug in sand and gravel (Wydoski and Whitney 1979).",,,,,,,,"In California, spawns late April-May. In British Columbia, spawns in winter (Beamish and Youson 1987). Adults die after spawning. Ammocoete stage lasts several years; transformation into adult stage occurs when ammocoetes reach about 12 cm TL. In British Columbia, metamorphosis begins in July and is completed in April of the following year (Beamish and Youson 1987).",,Adults may be eaten by game fishes during spawning migrations.,,"Transformed individuals migrate to sea and return to fresh water to spawn.

Adults are parasitic on various fish species (e.g., Pacific herring, Pacific salmon; mainly mid-sized salmonids); will attack fish in salt or fresh water; feeds mainly on muscle tissue and usually kills host in process of feeding.",,,,,,,,,,,"The river lamprey occurs as widely scattered, isolated populations (Moyle et al. 1995, Moyle 2002) along the Pacific Slope, from the Sacramento-San Joaquin drainage, California, to Tee Harbor near Juneau, Alaska (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 2011). 

In California, this species has been recorded from the lower Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (especially the Stanislaus and Tuolumne rivers); the Napa River, Sonoma Creek, and Alameda Creek (tributaries to San Francisco Bay); in Salmon Creek and in tributaries to the lower Russian River (Sonoma County, where the species appears to be a regular spawner); a single adult female was captured at Cape Horn Dam in the Eel River; this species has not been adequately surveyed in most California streams (Moyle 2002).

In Oregon, river lampreys have been found in sites 182 km apart in the Columbia and Yaquina rivers (Moyle 2002). According to the Center for Biodiversity, the species has not been documented in the Columbia River or anywhere in Oregon since 1980.

Detailed distribution records are not available for Washington, but the species probably occurs in major coastal drainages (Wydoski and Whitney 2003). 

In British Columbia, in the center of their range, river lampreys have been reported from the Strait of Georgia and Fraser River (Beamish and Neville 1995). A landlocked population exists in Morrison Creek, Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Renaud 1997).

In southeastern Alaska, the species has been recorded north of Juneau at Tee Harbor-Lynn canal area, Douglas Island, Taku River, and in Portland Canal (Mecklenburg et al. 2002). Probably it occurs coastally in areas south of Juneau.",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",21-Feb-12,,

In California, this species occurs in low elevation portions of streams and rivers; probably it is restricted to the less disturbed portions of streams (Moyle 1976). Spawning occurs in riffles on rock, sand, or gravel stream bottoms. Lampreys spawn in a shallow depressions at the heads riffles (Wydoski and Whitney 1979).",,,,,,,,"Spawns day or night, late April to July. Females 4.4 to 7.7 inches long produce 1,100 to 3,700 eggs (Wydoski and Whitney 1979). Eggs hatch in about 10 days at temperatures of 50-60 F. Ammocoete stage lasts up to 6 years. Metamorphosis August-November. The preceding information pertains to northern populations; little is known about California populations formerly known as L. pacifica.",,"Spawning success and survival apparently are high, as ammocoetes of this species are said to be one of the most abundant forms of life in the lower courses of streams in the northwestern United States (Scott and Crossman 1973).",,,,"Herbivore: Adult, Immature; Invertivore: Adult, Immature","Ammocoetes are filter feeders; feed on microscopic plant and animal matter, including desmids, diatoms, algae and detritus (Scott and Crossman 1973). Adults do not feed.",,,,,,,,,,,"Range includes streams of the North American Pacific coast from Taku River, southern Alaska, to central California, including Vancouver Island, with major inland distributions in the Columbia and Sacramento-San Joaquin drainages (Vladykov and Follett 1965, Moyle 2002, Wydoski and Whitney 2003, Page and Burr 2011). In Washington, this species occurs in coastal and Puget Sound streams and as far inland as the upper reaches of the Yakima River; recorded in streams on the west and south sides of the Olympic Peninsula but not on the north or east sides (Wydoski and Whitney 2003). This lamprey is relatively common in forested coastal basins, such as the Alsea River, Oregon. In California, western brook lampreys have been recorded mainly from the Sacramento River drainage, including areas as remote as Kelsey Creek above Clear Lake (Lake County), but they are also present above Pillbury Reservoir in the Eel River and in Mark West Creek, a tributary of the Russian River; spawning adults were collected in the Navarro River (Mendocino County) in 1999 (Moyle 2002). Ammocoetes from an extirpated population in the Los Angeles River basin may represent this species (Moyle 2002). Western brook lamprey is easily overlooked and difficult to collect, it is likely that this species occurs in many streams in coastal California (Moyle 2002).

Populations in the Columbia River basin, Oregon are reassigned to L. pacifica (Reid et al. 2011).",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",22-Feb-12,,

These characteristics make the stream very productive and provide a year round supply of clean groundwater. The substrates are mainly composed of compressed till with limited patches of small gravel and an abundance of woody debris (Beamish et al. 2001). The specific habitat features needed to support this polymorphic population are unknown (Beamish et al. 2001). In general, lamprey amnocoetes (larvae) require soft bottom substrates to burrow into and adults utilize gravel for spawning.",,,,"Referred to as Lampetra richardsoni var. marifuga by Beamish (1986) and Beamish et al. (2001). Since a ""variety"" is not a standard taxonomic category in zoology, this fish is regarded as an undescribed population of L. richardsoni.","Adults range in size from 10 to 15 cm; when not in spawning condition, distinguished from Lampetra richardsoni by its silver colour and countershading, which develops in early spring, and its prominent teeth (Beamish 1985); difficult to distinguish in October as both forms have similar dentition at this time (McDermott undated).",,,In the Morrison Creek form the sex ratio is highly skewed; it is about 80% males which contain gonads in an advanced stage of maturity when the females are immature or just beginning to mature (Beamish 1986). It is possible that the parasitic form is brought about by a slower sexual maturation and a slower and incomplete metamorphosis (Youson and Beamish 1991).,,Confined to freshwater as they are unable to osmoregulate in salt water (Beamish 1986).,,A nonanadromous form (Beamish et al 2001). Moves within the river primarily at night (Beamish 1986).,,,"Lamprey amnocoetes are filter feeders and live on microscopic plant and animal matter, including desmids, diatoms, algae, and detritus (Scott and Crossman 1973). In the lab the parasitic adult form fed on both live and dead fishes such as coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and the mucus covering of other species of dead lamprey; it preferred live herring (Clupea harengus pallasi) but can not feed on this species in the wild. Feeding began in July, was most active during September and ceased by mid November (Beamish 1986). As an adult this population may not feed and could die before spawning (Beamish et al. 2001). Adults of the more common form of L. richardsoni do not feed at all.",,,"The biology of this population is not well understood. They remain in freshwater throughout their life developing the silver colour in February and March and reproducing in May and June (Beamish 1986). They have been caught in traps between mid March and end of August (Beamish 1986). After hatching, the amnocoetes have burrowed into soft sediments where the remain for an unknown time (possibly three to seven years) before metamorphosing in July or August; the parasitic adults appear the following spring but are not completely mature and may delay another year before spawning (Youson and Beamish 1991). In the lab, some adults actively fed until mid-November (Beamish 1986).",,,,,,,"This population is endemic to a small stream on eastern Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Only known from the Morrison Creek watershed (9.3 km2), on Vancouver Island (COSEWIC 2010).

Adults seek shelter of pools or deep water during day. 

Spawning habitat includes shallow water in lakes or quiet areas of streams, often fairly close to shore. Lake populations may move a short distance up a stream to spawn. Females deposit eggs in nests made by males, usually near cover on gravel or sand bottoms. Individual males may nest close to the previous year's nest site(Ridgway et al. 1991).",,"The elongate body is compressed from side to side, the upper jaw does not extend beyond the rear edge of the eye in adults, the dorsal fin has two parts that are fairly broadly connected (front part is spiny, rear part has 13-15 (usually 14) soft rays), and the shortest spine at the rear of the front part of the dorsal fin is more than half as long as the longest spine. The sides have irregular dark vertical markings, the cheeks have four dark streaks that radiate from eye or snout, and a white spot is present at the rear end of the gill cover. This species never has a broad black stripe on each side. The tail fin of young is three-banded with yellow, black, and white (at the tip); this fades with age. Maximum total length is around 27.5 inches (69 cm).",,,,,,"Spawning occurs in late spring or early summer and may be interrupted by flooding. Eggs hatch in 2-10 days at 60-77F (15-25C). Males guards eggs and hatchlings. Fry leave the nest about 10-15 days after egg deposition. Parental care may last 4 weeks or longer. Individuals usually attain sexual maturity at age II in south, age VI in north (Moyle 1976, Becker 1983). Nests are solitary rather than colonial.",,"Usually stays within 5 miles of place of original capture, but longer movements have been recorded (Scott and Crossman 1973).",,May migrate short distances between spawning and nonspawning habitats (Moyle 1976).,,"Carnivore: Adult, Immature; Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","Fry eat mainly crustaceans and aquatic insects (e.g., chironomid larvae and pupae) until they are about 5 cm TL, when they start feeding heavily on fishes.

Typical habitats include farm ponds, swamps, lakes, reservoirs, sloughs, creek pools, and river coves and backwaters. Many of the largest populations are in mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes or reservoirs. In lakes and reservoirs these fishes are usually close to shore. In general, they are in deeper water in winter than in summer. 

Eggs are laid in shallow cleared depressions (nests) made by males in sand, gravel, or debris-littered bottoms, often at depths of 40-80 inches (1-2 meters) but up to at least 23 feet (7 meters) or as shallow as 8-12 inches (about 20-30 cm).

The overall color is silvery to brassy (brown in dark waters), with dark olive mottling; each side has a broad black stripe (continuous or broken into a series of blotches) that extends onto the snout. Maximum length is around 38 inches (97 cm).",,,,,,"Spawning occurs mainly in spring or early summer after water temperatures have become sufficently warm. Spawning occurs mid-April to mid-June near the southern end of the range in Alabama, late April to early July near the northern range limit in Wisconsin. In Texas, spawning begins as early as February or as late as May, depending on water temperature. Eggs hatch in a few to several days, depending on water temperature. Males guard the eggs and hatchlings until the young bass disperse about a month after hatching. Individuals become sexually mature in 2-5 years, depending on growth rate, which increases with increasing temperature.

Eggs hatch in 6-8 weeks. Females are sexually mature at 3-4 years, males at 2-3 years (Sigler et al. 1983). Females spawn up to five times during their lifetime. See Stearley (1992) for a discussion of the historical ecology and life history evolution of Pacific salmons and trouts (ONCORHYNCHUS).",,"In streams, cutthroats defend feeding territories. Population densities are regulated mostly by stream size and morphology, overwintering habitat, stream productivity, and summer cover for predator avoidance (New Mexico, Sublette et al. 1990).",,"In general, anadromous (sea going) and lake cutthroat trout make extensive spawning migrations; nonmigratory stream- dwelling cutthroats are often quite sedentary (Moyle 1976).

In summer and fall, radio-tagged cutthroat trout in Strawberry Reservoir in Utah had single-month home ranges that were usually about 3-4 km in maximum length (Baldwin et al. 2002). 

In the Blackfoot River drainage, Montana, radio-tagged westslope cutthroat trout moved 3-72 km (mean 31 km) to access spawning tributaries (Schmetterling 2001).",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","Opportunistic. Inland cutthroats feed primarily on insects (aquatic and terrestrial); often feeds in and especially downstream from riffle areas; some large individuals feed mostly on fishes; also eats zooplankton and crustaceans. Coastal cutthroats feed in salt water on crustaceans and fishes; in streams, they eat aquatic insects and crustaceans, also frogs, earthworms, fishes, fish eggs, salamanders, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,"Anadromous forms: Pacific Coast drainages from Eel River, California, north to Prince William Sound, Alaska, generally not more than 160 km inland; non-migrating fish also occur through this range. Allopatric inland forms: Rocky Mountains in Hudson Bay basin, Mississippi River basin, Great Basin (including Lahontan, Bonneville, and Alvord basins), and Pacific basin from southern Alberta south through California to the Rio Grande drainage, New Mexico, and east to Colorado and Montana (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 1991). The greatest abundance of pure interior cutthroat trout occurs in Yellowstone Lake and the Yellowstone River drainage above the falls in Yellowstone National Park (Behnke 1992). Widely stocked in and out of the original range. Established in Laurentian lakes, Quebec. However, rarely has become naturalized much beyond the original distribution (Behnke 1992). Occurrence in high elevation headwater lakes is due primarily to introductions (formerly excluded by falls) (Behnke 1992). Locally common (Page and Burr 1991).",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",11-Mar-03,,

well-shaded streams with water temperatures below 18 C are optimal (Moyle et al. 1989). Some may spend entire life in freshwater (many of these live in lakes), but most are anadromous (summer in saltwater). In summer, most individuals in streams are of the first-year age class; a few may be older nonanadromous fish and anadromous fish landlocked by rapidly receding water levels (Moyle et al. 1989). In marine habitats, generally remains close to the coast, usually remaining within estuary. 

Spawns in streams on clean, small gravel substrates; females dig multiple redds, cover eggs after spawning. After emerging, fry move into larger rivers (or lakes), migrate to sea during their first year (or sometimes in second or third year) (Moyle et al. 1989).",,,,,,,,"Main time of spawning typically is late winter or early spring, though May spawning has been reported for one area in Oregon (Bond, in Behnke 1992). Eggs hatch after 6-7 weeks; hatchlings emerge from gravel in 1-2 weeks (March-June); first breeds at 2-4 years, lives 4-7 years (Moyle et al. 1989). In Oregon, sea-run trout typically migrate to salt water in the late spring or early summer at age 2 or age 3 (though some may never go to sea); after 2-5 months in the sea, they return to rivers (Behnke 1992). The timing of migrations, age at migrations, length of time spent at sea, and spawning time vary among stocks and geographical areas (Behnke 1992). Reportedly, about 40% survive first spawning (see Stearley 1992); however, Behnke (1992) reported lower values of 5-30%, varying with angling pressure; 12-17% survived between second and third and third and fourth spawnings in a stream little used by anglers (see Behnke 1992). Sea-run trout attain a maximum age of about 10 years (Behnke 1992). See Stearley (1992) for a discussion of the historical ecology and life history evolution of Pacific salmons and trouts (ONCORHYNCHUS).",,"As evidenced by indicative scarring, predation at sea may be a significant cause of natural mortality (see Behnke 1992).",,"Migratory and nonmigratory stocks occur throughout the range (Behnke 1992). In northern California, begins to migrate up streams in September-October, following the first heavy rains; migrates up to 70-90 km inland in the Smith River, not so far in streams to the south (Moyle et al. 1989).",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","Adults eat insects, crustaceans, and other fishes. Young feed mostly on aquatic and drift insects, microcrustaceans, and occasionally smaller fishes. (Moyle et al. 1989).",,,,,,,,,,,"Small coastal streams from the Eel River, Humboldt County, California, north to the Prince William Sound area, Alaska, including numerous islands with suitable habitat off the coast of British Columbia and southern Alaska (Moyle et al. 1989, Behnke 1992). Typically does not occur farther inland than about 150 km (Behnke 1992). Both sea-run and anadromous stocks occur throughout the range. This is the most widely distributed and abundant subspecies of cutthroat trout, though its ""abundance"" is only relative to the other depleted subspecies (Behnke 1992). See Moyle et al.

Juveniles of migratory populations may spend 1-4 years in their natal streams, then move (usually in spring or early summer, and/or in fall in some systems) to a main river or lake where they remain until they spawn (Spahr et al. 1991, McIntyre and Rieman 1995). Many fry disperse downstream after emergence (McIntyre and Rieman 1995). Juveniles tend to overwinter in interstitial spaces in the substrate. Larger individuals congregate in pools in winter. 

Spawns in small tributary streams on clean gravel substrate; mean water depth is 17-20 cm and mean water velocity is 0.3-0.4 m/sec; tends to spawn in natal stream (see McIntyre and Rieman 1995). Adfluvial populations live in large lakes in the upper Columbia drainage and spawn in lake tributaries. Fluvial populations live and grow in rivers and spawn in tributaries. Resident populations complete the entire life history in tributaries. All three life-history forms may occur in a single basin (McIntyre and Rieman 1995). Migrants may spawn in the lower reaches of the same streams used by resident fishes. Maturing adfluvial fishes move into the vicinity of tributaries in fall and winter and remain there until they begin to migrate upstream in spring. Of migratory spawners, some remain in tributaries during summer months but most return to the main river or lake soon after spawning (Behnke 1992).",,"A trout with small, nonrounded spots, with few spots on the anterior body below the lateral line; coloration varies, but generally is silver with yellowish hints, though bright yellow, orange, and especially red colors can be expressed to a much greater extent than on coastal or Yellowstone cutthroat (Behnke 1992). Hybridization between westslope and Yellowstone cutthroat trout can produce a spectrum of spotting and coloration ranging between the typical patterns of each subspecies. Some populations that have been affected by hybridization show little or no phenotypic signs of hybridization (Behnke 1992). Hybridization with rainbow trout can be detected by the appearance of spots on the top of the head and on the anterior body below the lateral line, as well as by reduced scale counts, increased caecal counts, and loss of basibranchial teeth (see Behnke 1992).",,,,,,"Spawns March-July, depending on elevation, at water temperatures near 10 C; usually first spawns at age 4 or 5; alternate-year spawning has been reported in the Flathead River basin in Montana and elsewhere; repeat spawners may comprise up to about 24% of the adult population (Spahr et al. 1991, McIntyre and Rieman 1995).

In the Blackfoot River drainage, Montana, fishes spawned as flows subsided after the peak discharge; 38% of individuals died after spawning (Schmetterling 2001).",,Metapopulation theory may apply to this species (see McIntyre and Rieman 1995).,,"Resident populations spend entire life in small stream; migratory cutthroat may travel about 25-50 miles between breeding and nonbreeding habitats (Spahr et al. 1991). Trout from large lakes such as Coeur d'Alene, Priest, Pend Oreille, and Flathead lakes may migrate 150 km or more between spawning (upstream) and nonspawning (lake) habitats (Behnke 1992). Extent of migrations may vary with the availability of high quality pools suitable for overwintering. See also reproduction comments.

In the Blackfoot River drainage (Montana), 16 of 22 radio-tagged individuals migrated during the spawning period; migrations to tributaries occurred during the rising limb of the hydrograph; migratory fishes moved both upriver and downriver to reach spawning tributaries; in one year the mean distance traveled to access tributaries was 31 km (range 3-72 km); once in tributaries, individuals generally remained within a 200-m reach; neither of two repeat migrants spawned within 3 km of the previous year's spawning location, though both traveled in the same tributaries; after leaving tributaries fishes moved both upriver and downriver to overwintering areas and did not move more than 100 m thereafter; individuals did not exhibit fidelity to their prespawning main-stem locations; in general, fishes demonstarted the large spatial extent over which fluvial westslope cutthroat trout use aquatic resources (Schmetterling 2001).",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature","Feeds mainly on aquatic and terrestrial insects and zooplankton; diet includes relatively few fishes (Spahr et al. 1991, McIntyre and Rieman 1995).",,,,,,,,,,,"West of the Continental Divide, this subspecies is believed to be native to several major drainages of the Columbia River basin, including the upper Kootenai River drainage from its headwaters in British Columbia, through northwest Montana, and into northern Idaho; the Clark Fork River drainage of Montana and Idaho downstream to the falls on the Pend Oreille River near the Washington-British Columbia border; the Spokane River above Spokane Falls and into Idaho's Coeur d'Alene and St. Joe River drainages; and the Salmon and Clearwater River drainages of Idaho's Snake River basin (USFWS 2003).

Populations originating from different coastal regions of the North Pacific occupy distinct ocean nursery areas. The range shifts southward for winter, northward in warmer months (Heard 1991).

Spawning occurs in most tributary rivers of northeastern Asia (Korea to Siberia) and in North America from California and Oregon (rare in these states) north to the Aleutian Islands and Mackenzie River delta, Arctic and Pacific drainages. Arctic populations do not appear to be self-sustaining but may be expanding and so warrant monitoring. The species has been introduced in the Great Lakes, Newfoundland, and several European areas.

In the southern part of the range, the most significant runs are in streams tributary to Puget Sound. This salmon has been recorded from various streams in northern California, but spawning in California has been rarely observed and only in the lower Russian River.

Spawning occurs in just about any accessible coastal stream, generally in forested areas, usually at 6-12 C in loose coarse gravel at heads of riffles (or tails of pools) in rounded troughs excavated by females where water is 10-54 cm deep. Females construct and deposit eggs in each of several redds. Individuals generally spawn in their natal stream; however, rapid colonization of newly accessible habitat has been observed.

Young spend a few weeks to 2 years (varies geographically) in freshwater streams before migrating to the sea (young in the north spend a longer time in fresh water than do those in the south). Often this period is substantial and amounts to approximately half of the life cycle. Hatchlings that have left the spawning site seek shallow water, usually along stream margins. Older juveniles prefer pools and runs with good cover, high oxygen levels, and abundant invertebrate populations. Fry may summer in brackish water in southeastern Alaska.

Kokanee do best in large, cold, mountain lakes (Sigler and Sigler 1987), where the presence of well-oxygenated water is essential (Sublette et al. 1990).. Water temperatures above 60 degrees F (about 15.5 C) lead to significant mortality, especially among the young (see Sublette et al. 1990). Young are not often found in estuarine or inshore waters after reaching the marine environment (Pauley et al. 1989).

Kokanee usually spawn in tributary stream of lake, often in riffle over gravel substrate; sometimes along gravelly shore of lake where seepage outflows, springs, or wind-induced waves occur. Sockeye move up coastal rivers and spawn in streams. Female constructs a redd (several nesting pockets) in gravel (usually) or sand bottom.",,"Sockeye salmon have numerous small scale, one dorsal fin plus one adipose fin, and no spines in the fins. The upper surface and tail fin of adults lack distinct dark spots. The first gill arch has 28-40 long slender gill rakers. The ocean stage is blue-green on top, silvery below. Spawning adults have a green head and bright red body, with the colors most intense in males. Maximum length is about 33 inches (84 cm). Young have 8-14 elliptical to oval parr marks on each side.",,,,,,"Anadromous forms migrate from ocean waters up coastal streams and rivers to spawn in natal waters. They spend 1-4 years (usually 2 years) in the ocean before ascending streams (mainly in summer but some stocks as early as winter). Many stocks spawn in fall (peak often in October or November), but spawning extends into winter in some areas. Spawning sites often are in gravel riffles, sometimes along gravelly shores of lakes where seepage outflows, springs, or wind-induced waves occur. Eggs hatch in 6-9 weeks, depending on temperature, and larvae emerge 2-3 weeks later. Sockeye fry move upstream or downstream to nursery lakes, where the young spend 1-2 years (up to 3 or rarely 4 years in some areas of Alaska; usually 1 year in British Columbia) before going to sea, usually in spring; some populations use stream areas for rearing and may migrate to the sea soon after emergence. 

Many non-anadromous (kokanee) populations move from lakes into tributary streams to spawn, though some remain in lakes. They enter spawning streams from late spring to midsummer, depending on the population. Kokanee spawn in different areas from August to February, at temperatures of 40-55 F.",,"Life cycle of sockeye similar to kokanee except sockeye matures in the ocean rather than lakes. Kokanee often travels in large schools. (Sigler and Sigler 1987). Two studies each reported survival rate of 4-20% for marine portion of life cycle (see Pauley et al. 1989). Northern squawfish and rainbow trout may be important predators on young in some lakes. Schools of young in lakes disperse as dusk approaches, reform after dawn (Pauley et al. 1989). In Montana, the introduction of opossum shrimp (MYSIS RELICTA) was followed by an abrupt decline in the kokanee population, apparently due to zooplankton decline caused by shrimp predation (Spencer et al. 1991).",,"Anadromous forms migrate from ocean waters up coastal streams and rivers to spawn in natal waters; spend 1-4 years (usually 2 years) in ocean, 2 years in freshwater; ascend river, spend 1-8 months in lake, then move to natal spawning area. Many non-anadromous populations move from lakes into tributary streams to spawn, some remain in lakes. Enters spawning rivers from late spring to midsummer, depending on the population.",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","Kokanee feed on zooplankton. Young sockeye eat primarily planktonic crustaceans. At sea, young sockeye feed on zooplankton, small fishes and insects; as they grow they eat more fish.",,,"Kokanee: feeding generally heaviest from sundown to dark (Sigler and Sigler 1987). Young sockeye feeding heaviest in afternoon, lightest at night and early morning (Pauley et al. 1989).",,,,,,,,"During oceanic feeding and maturation, this salmon ranges throughout the North Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, and eastern Sea of Okhotsk north of 40 degrees north latitude; there is considerable intermingling of Asian and North American populations, and of North American populations from Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska streams; the range shifts southward for winter, northward during warmer months. Natural lake populations occur in Japan, former USSR, Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Yukon, and British Columbia. Anadromous forms occur in Asia from Hokkaido, Japan, to the Anadyr River (spawning mainly on the Kamchatka Peninsula); in North America, anadromous populations range from the Sacramento River, California, north to Point Hope, Alaska (common in north, rare south of Columbia River drainage). Major Alaskan spawning areas are in tributaries and lakes of the Kenai, Chignik, Naknet, Kuichak, Wood, and Kodiak Island river systems. South of Alaska in the Pacific Northwest, the major spawning river is the Fraser River system in British Columbia, with smaller runs in the Baker, Columbia, Cedar, Quinalt, and Ozette rivers in Washington. The Fraser River includes a number of important nursery lakes (Cultus, Adams, Harrison, Horsefly, Shuswap, and Quesnel) and many tributaries that support the major portion of the Pacific Northwest population. In eastern Washington, major nursery lakes for Columbia River are Lake Wenathchee and Osoyoos Lake. In western Washington, major nursery lakes are Quinalt Lake, Ozette Lake, Baker Lake, and Lake Washington. In a 1996 survey of populations in the contiguous U.S., one healthy native stock was identified (Wenatchee River, Washington). The kokanee (lake-stream form) has been introduced in many western states and elsewhere, but most transplants have been unsuccessful in establishing self-sustaining populations.",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",21-Jan-10,,

For spawning, they migrate up to several hundred kilometers upstream to their natal stream, where eggs are deposited in gravel bottoms of large streams and rivers.

Populations may differ dramatically in the timing of adult migration and, to a lesser extent, timing of spawning. There are two basic behavioral forms, stream-type and ocean-type. Stream-type chinook are typical of northern populations (i.e., Alaska and northern B.C.) and headwater (high elevation) tributaries of southern populations. These spend one full year as juveniles rearing in fresh water before migrating to sea, perform extensive offshore oceanic migrations, and typically return to their natal river in spring or summer, several months prior to spawning; occasionally males mature without ever going to sea. The ocean-type is typical of populations on the North American coast south of 56 degrees north latitude; these migrate to sea during their first year of life (normally within 3 months of emerging from spawning gravel), spend most of their ocean life in coastal waters, then return to their natal river in fall, a few weeks before spawning.",,"Numerous scales; one dorsal fin plus one adipose fin; no spines in fins; irregular black spots on back, both lobes of tail fin, dorsal fin, and adipose fin; gums black at base of teeth. In the ocean, chinook salmon are blue, green, or gray on the upper side, silvery-white on the flanks and belly. During the spawning season, chinook salmon are olive brown, red, or purplish, the color change being more pronounced in males than in females. Young have 6-12 large parr marks on each side. Total length to around 150 cm.",,,,,,"Overall, chinook salmon generally spawn at 2-7 years of age (typically 3-5) in fall, depending on the population. A small proportion of males (called jacks) mature after only spending about 6 months or 18 months at sea, and still others mature without having migrated to sea at all. Eggs hatch in about 2-3 months and alevins complete development in another 1-2 months (depending on temperature, hence related to latitude and elevation). Juveniles stay in fresh water for a few days or 1 year (rarely more). Adults die soon after spawning. Several distinct spawning populations may occur in one stream; these may differ in duration of juvenile rearing, size and date of ocean entrance, timing of adult return and spawning, age composition of spawners, fecundity, and egg size (see Nehlsen et al. 1991).",,,,"Anadromous; migrates up to several hundred km upstream to the stream in which they were spawned. Different races differ in the timing of adult migration and spawning. Oregon coastal chinook stocks vary in ocean migration; some stocks migrate north, some migrate south, and one stock has a mixed north and south migration (see Nehlsen et al. 1991). There are two basic behavioral forms, stream-type and ocean-type (see Salo 1991). Stream-type chinnok is typical of Asian populations and of northern populations and headwater tributaries of southern populations in North America; spends one or more years as fry or parr in fresh water before migrating to sea, performs extensive offshore oceanic migrations, returns to natal river in spring or summer, several months prior to spawning; occasionally males mature without ever going to sea. Ocean-type is typical of populations on the North American coast south of 56 degrees north latitude; migrates to sea during first year of life (normally within 3 months of emerging from spawning gravel), spends most of ocean life in coastal waters, return to natal river in fall, a few days or weeks before spawning.",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature",In fresh water juveniles feed opportunistically on terrestrial and aquatic insects. In salt water they eat crustaceans as well as other bottom invertebrates. Adults eat mostly fishes.,,,,,,,,,,,"Native range includes the Pacific Ocean and tributary drainages, in North America presently from the Sacramento-San Joaquin system (sometimes farther south) north to Point Hope, Alaska, and in northeastern Asia, from northern Japan to the Anadyr River. The species has been widely stocked elsewhere.

In the Columbia River basin, the Hanford Reach supports the largest population of fall chinook salmon; annual production is an estimated 20-25 million subyearling salmon (P. Hoffarth, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, unpublished data).",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",21-Jan-10,,

Young tend to occupy edges of streams in slower, shallow water (Cross 1975). Larger adults generally are in relatively quiet water where cover (e.g., overhanging trees, deadfalls, boulders) is available (Minckley 1985). 

Stream populations spawn in swift water over rocky substrates. Lake populations spawn in shallow waters with gravel substrate or on gravel edge of riffles in inlet streams (Moyle 1976). In Aravaipa Creek, Arizona, spawning occurred over rapids and riffles, at depths less than 25 cm, over substrates of gravel, cobble, or rubble (Minckley 1981). 

Mueller (1984) described spawning behavior of speckled dace in the San Francisco River, New Mexico. Spawning occurred in a 1-m square section of stream recently scoured by human activity. Spawning clusters formed, each with more than 25 fish. Dace thrashed violently (presumable at spawning) and eggs were found at depths to 5 cm. Most eggs were unexposed, attached to undersides of rocks or in interstices between rocks. Territoriality or spawning pairs were not observed. 

In the Virgin River (Utah, Arizona, Nevada), speckled dace were collected from 500 m to 1800 m elevation (Cross 1975). Sixty percent were collected in runs, 30 percent in pools, and 10 percent in riffles. Two-thirds of the collections were associated with gravel, rubble, or cobble substrates and one-third with sand and mud. Seventy percent were collected near some type of cover, usually overhanging trees, deadfalls, and boulders. Speckled dace were collected at current speeds averaging 0.43 m/sec (SD = 0.25 m/sec, range 0 to 1 m/sec) and at depths averaging 48 cm (SD = 43 cm). 

Speckled dace from the Virgin River (Utah, Arizona, and Nevada) preferred an average temperature of 15.8 C (range 9.5 to 16 C, depending on acclimation temperature) (Deacon et al. 1987). Critical thermal maxima were 30.5, 32.6, and 36.8 C for dace acclimated at 10, 15, and 25 C (Deacon et al. 1987). Rangewide, however, the speckled dace is found at much higher average temperatures, such as 29 C at Ash Meadows, Nevada, 28 C at Pahranagat Valley, Nevada (Deacon and Bradley 1972), and 29.4 C at Kendall Springs in Wyoming (Hubbs and Kuehne 1937). 

Lowe et al. (1967) showed that speckled dace, collected from Sonoita Creek, Arizona, were intolerant to elevated temperatures and reduced oxygen levels. Speckled dace were least tolerant to reduced oxygen levels when compared to Agosia chrysogaster, Catostomus clarki, and Cyprinodon macularius (Lowe et al. 1967).","In British Columbia, adults have been found in sections with rock habitat and slow to moderately strong current where siltation and scouring of the river bottom was not excessive (Peden 1984, G. Haas, pers. comm. 1992).
In early spring, adults were found in deep (>1m) runs often in the lee of large rocks, logs and bridge abutments (McPhail 2007). This is likely overwintering behaviour due to low water temperatures (COSEWIC 2006). In July to October, adults are usually found in relatively shallow water (0.1 - 0.65m) in areas with slow surface currents (
Juveniles are commonly caught in shallow water (
In August, fry were found along the river margins in shallow (","The following description is from Minckley (1973) and Sublette et al. (1990). The speckled dace is a chunky, rounded minnow. Adults reach lengths of 45-80 mm standard length (SL = length from tip of snout to end of hypural plate) (Wallace 1980). Usually there are 8 dorsal rays (6-9), 13-14 pectoral rays, 8 pelvic rays, and 7 anal rays. There are 60-90 scales along the lateral line. The mouth is subterminal, usually with no frenum. Pharyngeal arches contain teeth in two rows, usually 1,4-4,1 or 2,4-4,2. A single, small barbel is located at the edge of each jaw. Coloration is variable depending on geographic location, but often dark and blotchy dorsally, lighter ventrally. A lateral band extends from the dorsal fin onto the caudal peduncle. Breeding males have an intense red color at the base of paired fins, near the anal fin base, on the lower caudal lobe, near the upper part of the gill cleft, and on the mouth. Breeding tubercles are present on pectoral rays of males. Larval speckled dace from the upper and lower Colorado River basin were described by Snyder (1981) and Winn and Miller (1954), respectively.",,,,,,"Cross (1975) collected ripe females in late June and mid-July 1973 from the Virgin River drainage in Utah. In Aravaipa Creek, Arizona, speckled dace were collected in breeding coloration or with tubercles from December to August, with mature gonads from November to March, or seen engaged in spawning activities from January to April. Larvae were collected from January to April. 

John (1963) studied reproduction in Cave Creek, Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona. Females matured at two years of age. Peaks in reproductive activity were in early spring and late summer. John believed spawning efforts were triggered by flash floods. Males defended territories, and activities of the male often resulted in circular, clean gravel areas that John (1963) called nests. A female entered a defended area and partially buried or wedged herself under the edge of a stone. Males took positions next to the buried female and the pair or group vibrated for a few seconds, after which the female departed. A female entered a nest several times, depositing a portion of her ripe eggs during each spawning event. John (1963) gave data for the total number of eggs laid in an aquarium by each of eight females. From these data, Vives calculated that the number of eggs laid was related to standard length by the equation: number of eggs laid = -264.41 + 10.45 SL (mm) (R- squared = 0.89, p < 0.001). Females ranged from 45 to 75 mm SL and numbers of eggs laid ranged from 174 to 514. Eggs hatched in 6 days at 18 to 19 C under laboratory conditions. 

Maximum age of speckled dace in streams of the Chiricahua Mountains is 3 years (John 1964). Moyle et al. (1989) stated that some may live up to 5-6 years. 

Females from the Kettle River, British Columbia, Canada, did not mature until the end of their second year (Peden and Hughes 1981).",,"Associated with several different faunas depending on location. In the Gila River drainage, native associates include the spikedace (MEDA FULGIDA), roundtail chub (GILA ROBUSTA), loach minnow (TIAROGA COBITIS), longfin dace (AGOSIA CHRYSOGASTER), Sonora sucker (CATOSTOMUS INSIGNIS), desert sucker (CATOSTOMUS CLARKI), and Gila trout (ONCORYNCHUS GILAE). Historical associates included the woundfin (PLAGOPTERUS ARGENTISSIMUS), bonytail (GILA ELEGANS), squawfish (PTYCHOCHEILUS LUCIUS), flannelmouth sucker (CATOSTOMUS LATIPINNIS), and razorback sucker (XYRAUCHEN TEXANUS), all now extirpated from the Gila River basin. 

Populations show large fluctuations in size (Minckley 1969, Deacon and Bradley 1972). LaBounty and Minckley (1972) noted that increasing populations of longfin dace may result in decreasing populations of speckled dace in areas of overlap at intermediate elevations. There is not enough data to understand the nature of this relationship (i.e., whether or not it is cause-effect). 

Predators include introduced trouts (ONCORHYNCHUS AND SALMO spp.) in the Colorado River mainstream, flathead catfish (PYLODICTUS OLIVARIS) in the Salt River basin, and also introduced basses (MICROPTERUS spp.) and green sunfish (CHAENOBRYTTUS CYANELLUS) (Minckley 1985). THAMNOPHIS CYRTOPSIS (black-necked garter snake) is known to feed on speckled dace (John 1964). 

Mpoame and Rinne (1983) recorded the protozoan ICHTHYOPHTHIRIUS MULTIFILIIS, trematode ORNITHODIPLOSTOMUM PTYCHOCHEILUS, and the cestode LIGULA INTESTINALIS as parasites of speckled dace in Aravaipa and Hurricane creeks, Arizona. 

Generally occurs in small, loose groups.",,Lake populations may migrate short distances up inlet streams to spawn.,,"Herbivore: Adult, Immature; Invertivore: Adult, Immature","An omnivorous benthic feeder, at times feeding on drift in mid-water or rarely at the surface (Schreiber and Minckley 1981). The diet consists mostly of benthic insects, also includes other invertebrates, algae, and detritus (little or no plant material or detritus in some areas) (Sublette et al. 1990, Woodbury 1933, Greger and Deacon 1988). Young feed mainly on zooplankton. 

Of 97 individuals collected in October from the Columbia River drainage, Canada, 28 percent had consumed only filamentous algae, 39 percent contained only insect remains, and the remaining 33 percent contained algae and insect remains (Peden and Hughes 1981). 

Schreiber and Minckley (1981) examined food habits in Aravaipa Creek, Arizona, during January, April, July, and October, 1975, and January 1976. The diet included primarily riffle-dwelling insects, reflecting the association with riffle habitats. Ephemeropteran larvae made up greater than 70 percent of the diet, excepting one sampling period. Plecopteran, trichopteran, and dipteran larvae were used when available 

Speckled dace from Little Creek, New Mexico, collected on 18-20 June 1986, consumed primarily dipteran larvae (81 percent by number), ephemeropteran larvae (7 percent), and trichopteran larvae (4 percent) (van Eimeren 1988). At the same location, speckled dace collected on 24-26 October 1986 consumed dipteran larvae (47 percent by number), ephemeropteran larvae (29 percent) and trichopteran larvae (23 percent). Additionally, van Eimeren found little diet overlap between Gila trout and speckled dace even though they shared the same habitats. 

Greger and Deacon (1988) examined food habits of speckled dace on 9 February, 20 June, 28 September, and 12 December 1979, in the Virgin River, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Dace fed mostly on simuliid larvae in February and June and on chironomid larvae in September and December.",,,"In Lake Tahoe, California, most active at night, inactive during the winter. In New Mexico, feeds primarily between 9:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. In streams may be active throughout the year (Moyle 1976). Carter et al. (1986) studied larval drift of upper Colorado River fishes in Colorado from mid-June to September. Speckled dace made up 16-18% of larvae captured. More larvae were captured near shore than midstream. Highest numbers of larvae were captured between 2000 and 0400 h, and lowest numbers between 1600 and 2000 h, suggesting a diurnal pattern of avoidance of daylight.",,,,,,,,"The most ubiquitous fish in the western U.S. (Page and Burr 1991), ranging from the Columbia River drainage (north to southern British Columbia) to the southern Gila River drainage of Arizona and Sonora, Mexico (Peden and Hughes 1981, Minckley et al. 1986, Varela-Romero 1990, Wallace 1980); ecological range extends from small springs of Death Valley to high mountain brooks (Minckley 1985), including waters of the Columbia River basin, Klamath River basin, Oregon lakes, Lahontan basin, Bonneville basin, North-Central basins, Death Valley system, Sacramento River basin, Colorado River basin, and South California Coastal Region (Minckley et al. 1986). [Subspecies osculus was described from Babocomari Creek, Arizona (Girard 1856), but is extirpated there.

Most often captured along river banks at depths less than 1 m (Hughes and Peden 1988). Occurs in rivers that are relatively warm and productive; the species is absent from cold tributaries in the mountains. Has been also found in reservoirs where there is a rocky bottom and a noticeable current (Hughes and Peden 1988).,"Endemic to the Columbia River. Patchily distributed in the Kootenay, Alocan, Kettle, Similkameen, Slocan, Lower Pend d'Oreille rivers and in Mission Creek (Wilhelmson 2003). Found in productive, low elevation waters (Peden and Hughes 1988); with temperatures between 18-20 degrees Celsius; has been reported near bank slopes with 6-15% gradient; have been found at depths between 10 and 169 cm; prefers riverine habitat with large gravel or cobbles and large boulders with enough space to provide refuge; prefer habitat where water flow is strong enough to prevent siltation from forming (Wilhelmson 2003).",,,,"The Otter Creek population is isolated and morphologically distinct from other R. umatilla populations (D. McPhail, pers. comm.; A. peden, pers. comm.). Although the Similkameen populations are similar morphologically to Columbia River populations, those in the Kettle may be isolated and divergent (Peden and Hughes 1998; D. McPhail, pers. comm.).","Dark upper head and back; creamy flanks with large, irregular dark spots; caudal peduncle moderately narrow (2.3-2.7 into head length); dorsal and anal fins strongly curved; pointed caudal fin lobes; deep caudal fork (about 10% of total length); 9-10 dorsal rays; 56-72 scales along lateral line; snout overhangs the mouth; upper lip is free from the snout; horizontal mouth with small barbells; dorsal ""hump"" posterior to the head; adults rarely larger than 120 mm (fork length); females tend to be larger than males (Wilhelmson 2003).",,"Reproductive biology has not been investigated. Breeding probably occurs in late spring and summer if similar to that of congeners R. FALCATUS, R. CATARACTAE and R. OSCULUS (Scott and Crossman 1973, Peden and Hughes 1981).","Spawning occurs in mid-summer in the Columbia River (Baxter et al. 2003). Males mature at the end of their 2nd summer, but don't spawn until the next season, whereas, females mature 1 year later than males (Wilhelmson 2003). Fecundity ranged from 300 to 2,000 eggs in a sample of 5 females (Wilhelmson 2003). In the laboratory, eggs hatched in 6 days and emerged from gravel 1 week later (Wilhelmson 2003).",,"Where R. umatilla is sympatric with R. falcatus in British Columbia, it is more numerous and prefers stronger current. Other dominant, potential competitors are R. Cataractae and Cottus spp. Lower densities are observed in the Columbia River below HLK Dam compared to other times of the year (Wilhelmson 2003).",,"Little is known about movements and dispersal, however post-hatch pelagic and early juvenile stages exhibit limited swimming abilities, which would indicate a restricted capacity to disperse during these life stages (Wilhelmson 2003).","Herbivore: Adult, Immature; Invertivore: Adult, Immature","Food preferences unknown, but the closely-related R. OSCULUS is a bottom feeder. Young R. OSCULUS are primarily planktivores and adults feed mainly on aquatic insects, freshwater shrimp, plant material and zooplankton (Wydoski and Whitney 1979).","Low diversity in food items observed and these vary by season and prey availability (Wilhelmson 2003). General food items include mayflies, midges, periphyton and detritus; in the winter months feeding on mostly periphyton and detritus (Wilhelmson 2003). Diets of young-of-the-year and juveniles are similar (Wilhelmson 2003).",,,,,,,,,,"Columbia River drainage, British Columbia, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon; common (Page and Burr 1991). The species is known from the type locality of the Columbia River at Umatilla, Oregon, and from scattered localities throughout the Columbia drainage below the Arrow Lakes, Slocan Lake, and Kootenay Lake. In Canada, the species has a patchy distribution in the Columbia, Kootenay, Slocan, Kettle, and Similkameen rivers, and it is present in the lower Pend d'Oreille and Mission Creek (C. Wilhelmson, draft COSEWIC report, 2003). It may occur in rivers of northern Oregon and the Idaho portion of the Snake River, but inventories are needed to determine this (Hughes and Peden 1988, McPhail 1990).",,,,,,,"CANNINGS, S. G., AND G.

Young remain in gravelly streams for 1-5 years (generally 1-2 years, but up to 8 years in some areas), then (as smolts) enter sea (or lake in landlocked populations) and remain there for 1-4 years. Migration habitat between spawning area and ocean optimally should have a minimum of slow- or no-flow areas. At sea, may remain within influence of estuary or move as far as Greenland. Prior to spawning, holds in streams through summer and early fall; optimum conditions include pools of 6 ft or more, water velocity below 1.6 ft/sec, and temperatures of 50-54 F (Clark et al. 1993). 

Spawns in streams, usually in gravel-bottomed riffle above or below a pool. In Canada, streams with pH below 4.7 have no existing salmon runs; no impact was observed in streams with pH above 5.4 (Watt 1986, cited by Clark et al. 1993). Eggs are laid in a nest and covered with gravel. Normal egg development requires water temperatures less than 50 F (optimum 43 F). Rearing habitat includes shallow riffle areas interrupted by pools and deeper riffles. Parr require cover such as large rocks. Adults die or return to sea after spawning (males sometimes overwinter in stream). Usually spawns in natal stream.",,,,,,,,"Spawns in fall (late October and early November in Maine). Eggs hatch in early spring. Young spend 1-3 years in stream rearing habitat, go to sea (in spring), return to spawn after 1-4 winters at sea (most from New England spend two years at sea). Adults may spawn in more than one year. In Europe, the majority of the smallest adults spawned annually, the largest biennially (Jonsson et al. (1991). Apparently, severe post-spawning mortality is normal in natural habitats, but survivorship generally is higher in artificially ""reconditioned"" kelts or in lake-locked populations (Stearley 1992).",,,,"Migrates up to thousands of kilometers between freshwater spawning habitat and marine nonspawning habitat.

A spawning population, evidently derived from feral adults used for aquaculture, appears to be established in the Tsitika River in British Columbia, and freshwater and marine recoveries are well documented in Alaska (Volpe et al. 2000). Locally common, but depleted or extirpated from western and southern parts of range (Page and Burr 1991). The only remaining populations that are believed to consist, at least in part, of native fishes in U.S. rivers occur in Maine: Dennys, Machias, East Machias, Narraguagus, Pleasant, Ducktrap, and Sheepscot rivers (Colligan and Nickerson 1996); a few populations have been partially restored through hatchery production (Federal Register, 20 January 1994).",,,,,,,"Hammerson, G.",22-Nov-00,,

also large coldwater lakes and reservoirs. In the contiguous U.S., now extirpated in most large rivers that historically were inhabited; confined mostly to headwater streams. Conditions that favor the persistence of populations include stable channel, relatively stable stream flow, low levels of fine substrate sediments, high stream channel complexity with various cover types, temperatures not exceeding about 15 C, and the presence of suitable corridors for movement between suitable winter and summer habitats and for genetic exchange among populations (Rieman and McIntyre 1993). 

Migratory forms live in tributary streams for up to several years before migrating downstream into a larger river or lake, where they spend several years before returning to tributaries to spawn (Rieman and McIntyre 1993). Some or most juveniles move to larger rivers or to a lake by mid-summer, while others stay in spawning areas for 2-4 years (Spahr et al. 1991). Adults return to river or lake after spawning in small streams. May move to lower reaches of mainstream river for winter. Resident populations often occur in small headwater streams where they spend their entire lives (see Rieman and McIntyre 1993). In lakes, inhabits all depths in fall, winter, and spring; moves to cooler, deeper water for summer. 

Spawning usually occurs in gravel riffles of small tributary streams, including lake inlet streams. Spawning sites often are associated with springs (Rieman and McIntyre 1993). According to California Department of Fish and Game (1990), spawning requires a large volume of cold water. Optimum temperatures for incubation are about 2-4 C (see Rieman and McIntyre 1993). Constructs spawning redd. Young are closely associated with stream channel substrates (Rieman and McIntyre 1993). Areas with large woody debris and rubble substrate are important as juvenile rearing habitat (Spahr et al. 1991).",,Resident adults are 15-30 cm in length whereas migratory adults commonly exceed 60 cm (see Rieman and McIntyre 1993).,,,,,,"Spawns in late summer or fall, with falling temperatures between 5 C and 9 C. Eggs hatch in late winter or early spring. Fry emerge from gravel in April or May. Most information indicates that sexual maturity is attained in 5-7 years (also reported as 4-5 years). May spawn each year or in alternate years. Spawning populations may comprise four or more year classes, though one or two year classes may dominate. See Rieman and McIntyre (1993).",,"Resident and migratory form live together but whether they represent a single population or separate populations is unknown (Rieman and McIntyre 1993).

Individuals may move from streams into lakes or the sea to avoid high temperatures in summer. Some populations migrate between freshwater and saltwater habitats. Other populations (known as ""coasters"") live in lakes and migrate to streams to spawn, or they remain in the lake to spawn. Preferred water temperature is around 14-16 C; brook trout do poorly where water temperature exceeds 20 C for extended periods (see Sublette et al. 1990). Spawning occurs in cool water (usually less than 15 C) usually over gravel beds in shallow headwaters but also may occur in gravelly shallows of lakes if spring (groundwater) upwelling and moderate current or nearby surficial inflow (Quinn 1995) are present. Eggs are buried in nests in gravel. In Ontario, eggs were buried at 7-20 cm in bottom substrate (Snucins et al. 1992).",,,,,,,,"Spawning occurs in late summer (in north) or fall (October-November in many areas). Eggs hatch in 47 days at 10 C, in 165 days at 2.8 C. In Ontario, alevin emergence occurred over a 71-day period, coinciding with the spring thaw and an episodic pH depression (Snucins et al. 1992). Sexually mature in 2-3 years (also reported as first year for males, 2nd year for females). Only small percentages of returning migrants actually spawn; post-spawning mortality generally is low (Stearley 1992). In dense, small-stream populations, few live more than 3 years, whereas some live 9-10 years in large rivers and lakes in the northern part of the range (Behnke 2002).",,"Adults in streams may defend small feeding territories that extend several body lengths in diameter (Grant et al. 1989). In experimental stream communities, Resetarits 1991 found that brook trout negatively affected both growth and survival of the salamander GYRINOPHILUS PORPHYRITICUS; the presence of GYRINOPHILUS had no affect on relative condition or fecundity of SALVELINUS. SALVELINUS and GYRINOPHILUS affected the growth of the two-lined salamander EURYCEA and the crayfish CAMBARUS BARTONII. SALVELINUS caused CAMBARUS and EURYCEA to alter their activity levels and habitat; EURYCEA and CAMBARUS were able to avoid predation by SALVELINUS and GYRINOPHILUS but at a significant cost to growth.",,"Some populations spawn and undergo considerable development in fresh water but also feed and develop to some extent in salt water (Hartel et al. 2002). These ""salters"" or ""sea trout"" may coexist with nonmigratory brook trout. The timing of seaward migration is variable but generally occurs in spring in northern latitudes (Naiman et al. 1987). Migrants spend a few days to 4 months in coastal seawater not far (usually less than 45 kilometers) from their natal stream (Mullan 1958, Smith and Saunders 1958, Bergin 1984, Naiman et al. 1987, Montgomery et al. 1990, Ryther 1997). Although sea-run populations often are referred to as being ""anadromous,"" they are most accurately classified as ""amphidromous"" because they make regular feeding migrations to the sea while still undergoing significant freshwater growth (Collette and Klein-McPhee 2002).

Adults in some populations migrate seasonally between lakes and tributary streams. In the Great Lakes, these brook trout are known as ""coasters."" Some coasters remain permanently in lakes.

Movement can be extensive even within streams. For example, in the Kennebecasis River, New Brunswick, brook trout moved upstream 65-100 kilometers in spring after ice loss; summer movements were minimal; movements to spawning areas in fall were less than 10 kilometers, then the fish moved back downstream to wintering areas in the lower to middle reaches of the river (Curry et al. 2002).",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature; Piscivore: Adult, Immature","Feeds opportunistically on various invertebrate and vertebrate animals, including primarily terrestrial and aquatic insects and planktonic crustaceans.

Spirinchus and Gasterosteus aculeatus are the most common limnetic planktivores, although juvenile Oncorhynchus nerka are also potential competitors (Henderson et al. 1991). However, a detailed study has shown that there is little overlap in distribution and diet among these three species (Diewart and Henderson 1992). The density of predaceous fish in the lake is low; the primary predators of smelt are probably Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. mykiss (Diewart and Henderson 1992).",,"Appear to be nonmigratory populations, in contrast with the anadromous populations which reach at least Pitt Lake annually.",,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature","Smelt in Pitt Lake ate primarily copepods (about 70% volume) and cladocera (about 30% volume), with some Diptera larva present as well (Diewart and Henderson 1992).",,,"Present and active throughout the year. In Pitt Lake, catch per unit effort data shows a distinct peak in September, which is probably the result of an influx of anadromous smelt (Henderson et al. 1991). In July, smelt are concentrated in upper half of lake (i.e., closer to inlet), whereas in November a pattern is not obvious (catch per unit effort is very low) (Henderson et al. 1991).",,,,,,,,This species is endemic to British Columbia.

This species has been taken at depths up to at least 150 meters in the sea. Unverified records indicate presence up to several miles offshore in California and Alaska (USFWS 1994). In estuaries this fish usually is found in the middle or bottom of the water column (Moyle 2002). Adults in lakes occupy deep water by day, move upward in water at night (Wydoski and Whitney 2003). Spawning occurs in fresh water, over sandy-gravel substrates, rocks, and aquatic plants (Moyle 2002). Anadromous populations spawn in fresh water close to the ocean. After hatching, larvae move up into surface waters and are transported downstream into brackish-water nursery areas. Lake populations spawn in tributaries (Wydoski and Whitney 2003).",,,,,,,,"Spawns in second year in southern part of range. In British Columbia, spawns October-November; in California, December-February. According to Wang (1986, cited in USFWS 1994), spawns as early as November, as late as June, with peak February-April (evidently pertains to California). Females lay 5000-24,000 adhesive eggs. Eggs hatch in about 40 days (Lee et al. 1980). Young move downstream to lake or sea. Some adults survive spawning. In the Sacramento-San Joaquin system, California, good recruitment is postively correlated with high outflows into Suisun and San Pablo bays (better rearing habitat than areas farther upstream).",,Important as food for birds and piscivorous fishes.,,"Some populations are anadromous; migrate up coastal rivers to spawn. Some populations make seasonal shifts within estuaries (e.g., San Francisco Bay area and Delta; Moyle 2002). Males precede females to spawning sites.

Adults live at moderate sea depths (commonly 20-200 m but have been recorded as deep as 625 m) in echo-sounding layer not far from shore; young apparently occur in deeper water (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 1991, Willson et al. 2003). Spawns in coastal freshwater streams over bottoms of silt, sand, gravel, cobble or detritus but apparently prefer bar and riffle habitat containing sand or pea-gravel, seldom more than a few miles inland (Estes and Vincent-Lang 1984, Willson et al. 2003). Presence of spring freshets is a factor common to nearly all spawning streams or rivers; typically characteristic of rivers that drain large snowpacks or glaciers (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003).",,"Generally distinguished from other smelts by having the front of the dorsal fin begin well behind where the pelvic fin attaches to the body. Dorsally bluish to bluish black or brown, with fine black speckling; silvery white laterally and ventrally. Large pair of canine teeth on the vomer, 18-23 rays in the anal fin (Morrow 1980, Mecklenburg et al. 2002).

Maximum length recorded is 254 mm, generally",,,,,,"Spawns in the spring. Females produce 17,000- 40,000 eggs (Scott and Crossman 1973); average fecundity is around 25,000 eggs per female (Drake and Wilson 1991). Eggs incubate in sediment for 2-3 weeks, depending on water temperature, then hatch and larvae are carried downstream to the sea (Willson et al. 2003). Most adults die soon after spawning, may live 5 years. Generally semelparous, with sexual maturity reached at around age 3 or 4 (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003). Spawning occurs at night, and males and females must synchronize activity closely because eulachon sperm remain viable for only a short time, possibly minutes (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003). Spawning migration timing is variable and appears to be related to water temperature and the occurrence of high tides. Runs occur from February to June throughout species range, but generally occur in April or May; in some rivers more than one run occurs (Willson et al. 2003).",,"A valuable food source for many animals because of extremely high oil content (about 20%, or 4-5 times higher than most other fish of comparable size) (Payne et al. 1999 in Hay and McCarter 2000). Predators include sea birds and ducks, marine and terrestrial mammals, and humans (Lee et al. 1980, Willson et al. 2003). Predators often congregate at eulachon spawning runs. Used historically and currently for an essential source of oil and food by Native Americans throughout their range (Drake and Wilson 1991). Called candlefish because a dried fish threaded with a wick will burn like a candle (Hay and McCarter 2000).",,Anadromous. Migrates short distances up coastal streams to spawn.,,"Invertivore: Adult, Immature","Eats crustaceans. Adults do not feed while in fresh water. Mainly a particulate feeder as opposed to a filter feeder, consuming primarily marine euphausiid crustaceans (Thysanoessa spp.) (Hay and McCarter 2000). Young fish eat mostly copepod larvae, phytoplankton, copepods and other zooplankton, and smaller eulachon larvae; diet of juvenile fish consists of euphausiids, like adults (Morrow 1980).",,,"Spawning migrations usually occur in April and May, often corresponding to high tides; spawning activity occurs at night (Willson et al. 2003).",,,,,,,,"Found only in the eastern Pacific, from Monterey Bay, California, to Nushagak River and Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, Alaska (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 1991). Distribution coincides closely with coastal temperate rainforest, although there may not be a functional linkage (Hay and McCarter 2000). Historically spawned in the Sacramento River system and farther south along the California and Baja California coast but have been extirpated from those locations, occurring now only as far south as Monterey Bay (one record from this location) and in the Klamath River in California, rivers in Oregon and the Columbia River in Washington (Hay and McCarter 2000, Mecklenburg et al. 2002, Willson et al. 2003). Surveys of Washington State rivers (outside the Columbia River watershed) in 2011 and 2012 found eggs/larvae in two rivers in the Willapa Bay system and the Chehalis River in the Grays Harbor system (Storch et al. 2014). In Alaska, seasonally abundant in most major drainages from Southeast Alaska west to Cook Inlet and become less abundant westward toward the Aleutian Islands and the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea (Fritz et al. 1993, Willson et al. 2003).",,,,,,,"Gotthardt, T.

Adults move to pools after spawning, spend winter in deep water. Spawning takes place in creeks with gravel-bottomed riffles. Spawning in lakes is rare. Does not construct a redd. Lake populations can spawn in either inlet or outlet streams. At Deer Lake, Montana, most young apparently entered the lake from the outlet stream spawning area during the 6-7-month period of annual ice cover; a small proportion of the fry were lost over a downstream waterfall (Deleray and Kaya 1992). In contrast, young in populations that spawn in inlet streams generally enter lakes much sooner.
